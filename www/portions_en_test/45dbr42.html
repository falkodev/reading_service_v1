Chapter <a id='c15v1' href='#recherchec15v1'>15</a> &ldquo;At the end of every seven years, you should grant a release. <input type='hidden' value='15:1'><a id='c15v2' href='#recherchec15v2'>2</a>&nbsp;This is the nature of the release: Every creditor will release his neighbor from the debt he incurred. He should not demand payment from his neighbor or his brother, for it will be proclaimed a release to Jehovah. <input type='hidden' value='15:2'><a id='c15v3' href='#recherchec15v3'>3</a>&nbsp;You may demand payment from the foreigner, but you should release your claim on whatever your brother owes you. <input type='hidden' value='15:3'><a id='c15v4' href='#recherchec15v4'>4</a>&nbsp;However, no one among you should become poor, for Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, <input type='hidden' value='15:4'>5&nbsp;but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today. <input type='hidden' value='15:5'><a id='c15v6' href='#recherchec15v6'>6</a>&nbsp;For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not need to borrow; and you will dominate many nations, but they will not dominate you.

If he calls out to Jehovah against you, it will be a sin on your part. <input type='hidden' value='15:9'>10&nbsp;You should generously give to him, and you should not give to him grudgingly, for this is why Jehovah your God will bless your every deed and undertaking. <input type='hidden' value='15:10'><a id='c15v11' href='#recherchec15v11'>11</a>&nbsp;For there will always be poor people in the land.

Just as Jehovah your God has blessed you, you should give to him. <input type='hidden' value='15:14'>15&nbsp;Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God redeemed you. That is why I am commanding you to do this today.

You should do the same with your slave girl. <input type='hidden' value='15:17'>18&nbsp;Do not consider it a hardship when you set him free and he leaves you, because his service to you for six years was worth twice as much as that of a hired worker, and Jehovah your God has blessed you in everything that was done.

<div id='recherchec15v1'><b><a href='#c15v1'>15:1 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : The seventh in each cycle of seven years; during this year, in ancient Israel the land was allowed to rest, lying uncultivated, and fellow Hebrews were not pressed for payment of debts. Counting from 1473&nbsp;B.C.E., the year that Israel entered the Promised Land, a sabbath year was to be celebrated &ldquo;at the end of every seven years,&rdquo; actually on every seventh year. (De 15:1, 2,&nbsp;12; compare De 14:28.) The Sabbath year evidently began with the trumpet blast on Ethanim (Tishri) 10, the Day of Atonement. However, some hold that, while the Jubilee year started with the Day of Atonement, the Sabbath year started with Tishri&nbsp;1. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v2'><b><a href='#c15v2'>15:2 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 601</b> : According to Deuteronomy 15:1-3, it appears that during the Sabbath year (every seventh year) a creditor could not press a fellow Israelite for payment of a debt. Unlike the Sabbath-keeping Israelite who realized virtually no return from his land, the foreigner continued to have an income from his nonagricultural work. Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. <br><br><b>it-2 833</b> : There was also to be a rest, or a release, on debts incurred. It was &ldquo;a release to Jehovah,&rdquo; in honor of him. Though others view it differently, some commentators hold that the debts were not actually canceled, but, rather, that a creditor was not to press a fellow Hebrew for payment of a debt, for there would be no income for the farmer during that year; though the lender could press a foreigner for payment. (De 15:1-3) Some rabbis hold the view that debts for loans of charity to help a poor brother were canceled, but that debts incurred in business dealings were in a different category. It is said by them that, in the first century of the Common Era, Hillel instituted a procedure whereby the lender could go before the court and secure his debt against forfeiture by making a certain declaration.&mdash;The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, edited by J.&nbsp;Hertz, London, 1972, pp.&nbsp;811, 812. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v4'><b><a href='#c15v4'>15:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122</b> : It was on the tenth day of the seventh month (in the month of Tishri), on the Day of Atonement, that the horn (shoh&middot;phar&prime;, or sho&middot;phar&prime;, a curved, animal horn) was sounded, proclaiming liberty throughout the land. This meant freedom for the Hebrew slaves, many of whom had sold themselves because of debt. Such release normally would not come until the seventh year of servitude (Ex 21:2), but the Jubilee provided liberty even for those who had not yet served for six years. All hereditary land possessions that had been sold (usually because of financial reverses) were returned, and each man returned to his family and his ancestral possession. No family was to sink into the depths of perpetual poverty. Every family was to have its honor and respect. Even a person who squandered his substance could not forever lose his inheritance for his posterity. After all, the land was really Jehovah&rsquo;s, and the Israelites themselves were alien residents and settlers from Jehovah&rsquo;s standpoint. (Le 25:23,&nbsp;24) If the nation kept God&rsquo;s laws, then, as he said, &ldquo;No one should come to be poor among you.&rdquo;&mdash;Le 25:8-10,&nbsp;13;&nbsp;De 15:4,&nbsp;5. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v6'><b><a href='#c15v6'>15:6 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122-123</b> : The wonderful provision of the Jubilee year can better be appreciated when one considers not only the beneficial results to the individual Israelites but especially the effect on the nation as a whole. When the Jubilee arrangement was properly observed, the nation was restored in the Jubilee year to the full and proper theocratic state that God purposed and established at the beginning. Government was on a sound basis. The national economy would always be stable, and the nation would have no crushing debt. (De 15:6) The Jubilee brought about a stable standard of land values and also prevented a great internal debt and its resultant false prosperity that brings inflation, deflation, and business depression. The Jubilee law, when obeyed, preserved the nation from gravitating to the sad state that we observe today in many lands, where there are virtually only two classes, the extremely rich and the extremely poor. The benefits to the individual strengthened the nation, for none would be underprivileged and crushed into unproductiveness by a bad economic situation, but all could contribute their talents and abilities to the national welfare. With Jehovah providing blessings of the yield of the ground and with the education that was provided, Israel, while obedient, would enjoy the perfect government and prosperity that only the true theocracy could provide.&mdash;Isa 33:22. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v7'><b><a href='#c15v7'>15:7 </a></b> <br><b>w10 9/15 8</b> : 5 Consider how such trusting obedience might have been manifested by keeping the law stated at Deuteronomy 15:7,&nbsp;8. (Read.) Begrudging compliance with that law might have resulted in some initial relief to the poor, but would it have engendered good relationships and an atmosphere of warmth among God&rsquo;s people? More important, would it have reflected faith in Jehovah&rsquo;s ability to provide for his servants and appreciation for the opportunity to mirror his generosity? Hardly! God took note of the heart condition of the truly generous person and promised to bless him in his every deed and every undertaking. (Deut. 15:10) Faith in that promise would give rise to action and would result in many rich blessings.&mdash;Prov. 28:20. <br></div><br>

Unlike the Sabbath-keeping Israelite who realized virtually no return from his land, the foreigner continued to have an income from his nonagricultural work. Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. At the approach of the Sabbath year, some Israelites, knowing that they would not be able to press matters, may have refrained from lending to their needy brothers. But the Law condemned such selfishness.&mdash;De 15:9. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v11'><b><a href='#c15v11'>15:11 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 939</b> : Actually, there should have been no poor persons among the Israelites, for Jehovah promised to bless his people. But the absence of poverty was contingent on obedience to the Law. Therefore, because of human imperfection and disobedience to God&rsquo;s law, the Israelites would always have the poor in their midst. (De 15:4, 5,&nbsp;11) <br><br><b>it-2 652</b> : Faithful adherence to God&rsquo;s law would largely have prevented poverty among the Israelites. (De 15:4,&nbsp;5) However, if disobedient, they would not have Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, and this would lead to impoverishment due to such calamities as invasions by enemy armies and severe drought. (De 28:22-25; compare Jg 6:1-6;&nbsp;1Ki 17:1;&nbsp;18:17, 18;&nbsp;Jas 5:17,&nbsp;18.) Individuals, because of being lazy (Pr 6:10, 11;&nbsp;10:4;&nbsp;19:15;&nbsp;20:13;&nbsp;24:30-34), drunkards, gluttons (Pr 23:21), or pleasure-seekers (Pr 21:17), could bring poverty on themselves and their families. Then, too, unforeseen circumstances might arise that could plunge persons into poverty. Death could leave behind orphans and widows. Accidents and sickness could temporarily or permanently hinder a person from performing necessary work. For these reasons Jehovah could say to Israel: &ldquo;Someone poor will never cease to be in the midst of the land.&rdquo;&mdash;De 15:11. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v12'><b><a href='#c15v12'>15:12 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : This year of release, or rest from being pressed for payment of debts, did not apply to the release of slaves, many of whom would be in slavery because of indebtedness. Rather, the Hebrew slave was released in the seventh year of his servitude or on the Jubilee, whichever came first.&mdash;De 15:12;&nbsp;Le 25:10,&nbsp;54. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v23'><b><a href='#c15v23'>15:23 </a></b> <br><b>w00 10/15 30-31</b> : Occasionally, a doctor will urge a patient to deposit his own blood weeks before surgery (preoperative autologous blood donation, or PAD) so that if the need arises, he could transfuse the patient with his own stored blood. However, such collecting, storing, and transfusing of blood directly contradicts what is said in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Blood is not to be stored; it is to be poured out&mdash;returned to God, as it were. Granted, the Mosaic Law is not in force now. Nevertheless, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses respect the principles God included in it, and they are determined to &lsquo;abstain from blood.&rsquo; Hence, we do not donate blood, nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be &lsquo;poured out.&rsquo; That practice conflicts with God&rsquo;s law. <br></div><br>
