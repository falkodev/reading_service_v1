<a id='c16v18' href='#recherchec16v18'>18</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;You should appoint judges and officers for each tribe in all the cities that Jehovah your God is giving you, and they must judge the people with righteous judgment. <input type='hidden' value='16:18'><a id='c16v19' href='#recherchec16v19'>19</a>&nbsp;You must not pervert justice, show partiality, or accept a bribe, for the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts the words of the righteous. <input type='hidden' value='16:19'>20&nbsp;Justice&mdash;justice you should pursue, so that you may keep living and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.

<a id='c16v21' href='#recherchec16v21'>21</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;You should not plant any sort of tree as a sacred pole near the altar of Jehovah your God that you make for yourself.

22&nbsp;&ldquo;Neither should you set up a sacred pillar for yourself, something Jehovah your God hates.

17 &ldquo;You must not sacrifice to Jehovah your God a bull or a sheep that has a defect or anything wrong with it, for it would be detestable to Jehovah your God.

2&nbsp;&ldquo;Suppose a man or a woman is found among you, in any of your cities that Jehovah your God is giving you, who is practicing what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah your God and violating his covenant, <input type='hidden' value='17:2'>3&nbsp;and he goes astray and worships other gods and he bows down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, a thing that I have not commanded. <input type='hidden' value='17:3'>4&nbsp;When it is reported to you or you hear about it, then you should investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, <input type='hidden' value='17:4'>5&nbsp;you must bring the man or the woman who has done this evil thing out to the city gates, and the man or the woman must be stoned to death. <input type='hidden' value='17:5'>6&nbsp;On the testimony of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die should be put to death. He must not be put to death on the testimony of one witness. <input type='hidden' value='17:6'><a id='c17v7' href='#recherchec17v7'>7</a>&nbsp;The hand of the witnesses should be the first to come against him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. You must remove what is bad from your midst.

8&nbsp;&ldquo;If a case arises in one of your cities that is too difficult for you to judge, whether it is a case involving bloodshed or a legal claim that has been raised or a violent deed that has been committed or other matters of dispute, you should rise up and go to the place that Jehovah your God chooses. <input type='hidden' value='17:8'>9&nbsp;Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge serving in those days, and make your inquiry, and they will hand down the decision to you. <input type='hidden' value='17:9'>10&nbsp;Then you must act according to the decision that they hand down to you from the place that Jehovah chooses. Be careful to do according to all that they instruct you. <input type='hidden' value='17:10'><br><br>

The sacred poles apparently stood upright and were made of wood, or at least contained wood, the Israelites being commanded to cut them down and to burn them. (Ex 34:13;&nbsp;De 12:3) They may have simply been uncarved poles, perhaps even trees in some instances, for God&rsquo;s people were instructed: &ldquo;You must not plant for yourself any sort of tree as a sacred pole.&rdquo;&mdash;De 16:21. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec17v7'><b><a href='#c17v7'>17:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 787</b> : EXPELLING<br><br><b>it-2 234</b> : One who proved to be a false witness received the punishment that the person accused would have received if found guilty. (De 19:17-21) Witnesses in all capital convictions were required to throw the first stone in the execution of the convicted one. Thus witnesses were enjoined by law to demonstrate their zeal for true, clean worship and for clearing out what was bad in Israel. This would also act as a deterrent to false testimony. It would take a very callous person to make a false accusation, knowing that he had to be the first to act in putting the accused to death.&mdash;De 17:7. <br><br><b>1037</b> : Before a wrongdoer could be stoned, at least two witnesses had to give harmonious testimony against him, and thereafter they cast the first stones. (Le 24:14;&nbsp;De 17:6,&nbsp;7) The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent to false testimony, which, if discovered, would cost the lying witness his own life.&mdash;De 19:18-20. <br></div><br><br>
