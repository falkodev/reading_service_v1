The Hebrew word translated &ldquo;intoxicating liquor&rdquo; is related to an Akkadian word that can refer to the common barley beer of Mesopotamia. That beverage was low in alcohol but potentially intoxicating if drunk in excess. (Proverbs 20:1) Clay models of breweries and paintings of brewers have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. In Babylon, beer was an everyday drink both in palaces and in the homes of the poor. The Philistines enjoyed a similar brew. Throughout Palestine, archaeologists have found jugs equipped with strainer spouts. Those vessels strained the beer, preventing drinkers from swallowing husks of the barley from which it was brewed. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v1'><b><a href='#c15v1'>15:1 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : The seventh in each cycle of seven years; during this year, in ancient Israel the land was allowed to rest, lying uncultivated, and fellow Hebrews were not pressed for payment of debts. Counting from 1473&nbsp;B.C.E., the year that Israel entered the Promised Land, a sabbath year was to be celebrated &ldquo;at the end of every seven years,&rdquo; actually on every seventh year. (De 15:1, 2,&nbsp;12; compare De 14:28.) The Sabbath year evidently began with the trumpet blast on Ethanim (Tishri) 10, the Day of Atonement. However, some hold that, while the Jubilee year started with the Day of Atonement, the Sabbath year started with Tishri&nbsp;1. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v2'><b><a href='#c15v2'>15:2 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 601</b> : According to Deuteronomy 15:1-3, it appears that during the Sabbath year (every seventh year) a creditor could not press a fellow Israelite for payment of a debt. Unlike the Sabbath-keeping Israelite who realized virtually no return from his land, the foreigner continued to have an income from his nonagricultural work. Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. <br><br><b>it-2 833</b> : There was also to be a rest, or a release, on debts incurred. It was &ldquo;a release to Jehovah,&rdquo; in honor of him. Though others view it differently, some commentators hold that the debts were not actually canceled, but, rather, that a creditor was not to press a fellow Hebrew for payment of a debt, for there would be no income for the farmer during that year; though the lender could press a foreigner for payment. (De 15:1-3) Some rabbis hold the view that debts for loans of charity to help a poor brother were canceled, but that debts incurred in business dealings were in a different category. It is said by them that, in the first century of the Common Era, Hillel instituted a procedure whereby the lender could go before the court and secure his debt against forfeiture by making a certain declaration.&mdash;The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, edited by J.&nbsp;Hertz, London, 1972, pp.&nbsp;811, 812. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v4'><b><a href='#c15v4'>15:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122</b> : It was on the tenth day of the seventh month (in the month of Tishri), on the Day of Atonement, that the horn (shoh&middot;phar&prime;, or sho&middot;phar&prime;, a curved, animal horn) was sounded, proclaiming liberty throughout the land. This meant freedom for the Hebrew slaves, many of whom had sold themselves because of debt. Such release normally would not come until the seventh year of servitude (Ex 21:2), but the Jubilee provided liberty even for those who had not yet served for six years. All hereditary land possessions that had been sold (usually because of financial reverses) were returned, and each man returned to his family and his ancestral possession. No family was to sink into the depths of perpetual poverty. Every family was to have its honor and respect. Even a person who squandered his substance could not forever lose his inheritance for his posterity. After all, the land was really Jehovah&rsquo;s, and the Israelites themselves were alien residents and settlers from Jehovah&rsquo;s standpoint. (Le 25:23,&nbsp;24) If the nation kept God&rsquo;s laws, then, as he said, &ldquo;No one should come to be poor among you.&rdquo;&mdash;Le 25:8-10,&nbsp;13;&nbsp;De 15:4,&nbsp;5. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v6'><b><a href='#c15v6'>15:6 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122-123</b> : The wonderful provision of the Jubilee year can better be appreciated when one considers not only the beneficial results to the individual Israelites but especially the effect on the nation as a whole. When the Jubilee arrangement was properly observed, the nation was restored in the Jubilee year to the full and proper theocratic state that God purposed and established at the beginning. Government was on a sound basis. The national economy would always be stable, and the nation would have no crushing debt. (De 15:6) The Jubilee brought about a stable standard of land values and also prevented a great internal debt and its resultant false prosperity that brings inflation, deflation, and business depression. The Jubilee law, when obeyed, preserved the nation from gravitating to the sad state that we observe today in many lands, where there are virtually only two classes, the extremely rich and the extremely poor. The benefits to the individual strengthened the nation, for none would be underprivileged and crushed into unproductiveness by a bad economic situation, but all could contribute their talents and abilities to the national welfare. With Jehovah providing blessings of the yield of the ground and with the education that was provided, Israel, while obedient, would enjoy the perfect government and prosperity that only the true theocracy could provide.&mdash;Isa 33:22. <br></div><br>

(Read.) Begrudging compliance with that law might have resulted in some initial relief to the poor, but would it have engendered good relationships and an atmosphere of warmth among God&rsquo;s people? More important, would it have reflected faith in Jehovah&rsquo;s ability to provide for his servants and appreciation for the opportunity to mirror his generosity? Hardly! God took note of the heart condition of the truly generous person and promised to bless him in his every deed and every undertaking. (Deut. 15:10) Faith in that promise would give rise to action and would result in many rich blessings.&mdash;Prov. 28:20. <br></div><br>

Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. At the approach of the Sabbath year, some Israelites, knowing that they would not be able to press matters, may have refrained from lending to their needy brothers.

<div id='recherchec15v11'><b><a href='#c15v11'>15:11 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 939</b> : Actually, there should have been no poor persons among the Israelites, for Jehovah promised to bless his people. But the absence of poverty was contingent on obedience to the Law. Therefore, because of human imperfection and disobedience to God&rsquo;s law, the Israelites would always have the poor in their midst. (De 15:4, 5,&nbsp;11) <br><br><b>it-2 652</b> : Faithful adherence to God&rsquo;s law would largely have prevented poverty among the Israelites. (De 15:4,&nbsp;5) However, if disobedient, they would not have Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, and this would lead to impoverishment due to such calamities as invasions by enemy armies and severe drought. (De 28:22-25; compare Jg 6:1-6;&nbsp;1Ki 17:1;&nbsp;18:17, 18;&nbsp;Jas 5:17,&nbsp;18.) Individuals, because of being lazy (Pr 6:10, 11;&nbsp;10:4;&nbsp;19:15;&nbsp;20:13;&nbsp;24:30-34), drunkards, gluttons (Pr 23:21), or pleasure-seekers (Pr 21:17), could bring poverty on themselves and their families. Then, too, unforeseen circumstances might arise that could plunge persons into poverty. Death could leave behind orphans and widows. Accidents and sickness could temporarily or permanently hinder a person from performing necessary work. For these reasons Jehovah could say to Israel: &ldquo;Someone poor will never cease to be in the midst of the land.&rdquo;&mdash;De 15:11. <br></div><br><br>
