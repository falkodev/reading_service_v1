8&nbsp;&ldquo;If a case arises in one of your cities that is too difficult for you to judge, whether it is a case involving bloodshed or a legal claim that has been raised or a violent deed that has been committed or other matters of dispute, you should rise up and go to the place that Jehovah your God chooses. <input type='hidden' value='17:8'>9&nbsp;Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge serving in those days, and make your inquiry, and they will hand down the decision to you. <input type='hidden' value='17:9'>10&nbsp;Then you must act according to the decision that they hand down to you from the place that Jehovah chooses. Be careful to do according to all that they instruct you. <input type='hidden' value='17:10'>11&nbsp;You must act according to the law that they show you and according to the decision that they declare to you. Do not deviate from the decision that they will hand down to you, either to the right or to the left. <input type='hidden' value='17:11'>12&nbsp;The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who is ministering to Jehovah your God or to the judge must die. You must remove what is bad from Israel. <input type='hidden' value='17:12'>13&nbsp;All the people will then hear and become afraid, and they will not act presumptuously anymore.

14&nbsp;&ldquo;When you enter the land that Jehovah your God is giving you and you have taken possession of it and are living in it, and you say, &lsquo;Let me appoint a king over myself like all the nations around me,&rsquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:14'>15&nbsp;in that case, you should without fail appoint a king whom Jehovah your God chooses. You should appoint a king from among your brothers. You are forbidden to appoint over yourself a foreigner who is not your brother. <input type='hidden' value='17:15'><a id='c17v16' href='#recherchec17v16'>16</a>&nbsp;However, he should not acquire many horses for himself or make the people go back to Egypt in order to obtain more horses, since Jehovah told you, &lsquo;You must never go back again by this way.&rsquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:16'>17&nbsp;Neither should he take many wives for himself, so that his heart may not go astray; nor should he acquire vast amounts of silver and gold for himself. <input type='hidden' value='17:17'><a id='c17v18' href='#recherchec17v18'>18</a>&nbsp;When he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write for himself in a book a copy of this Law, taken from the one kept by the Levitical priests.

They will eat of the offerings made by fire to Jehovah, which are his inheritance. <input type='hidden' value='18:1'>2&nbsp;So they should have no inheritance in the midst of their brothers. Jehovah is their inheritance, just as he has spoken to them.

3&nbsp;&ldquo;Now this will be the due right of the priests from the people: Whoever makes a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep, is to give the shoulder, the jaws, and the stomach to the priest. <input type='hidden' value='18:3'>4&nbsp;The firstfruits of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first wool that is shorn from your flock you should give him. <input type='hidden' value='18:4'>5&nbsp;Jehovah your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes to minister in the name of Jehovah always.

6&nbsp;&ldquo;But if a Levite leaves one of your cities in Israel where he was living and he desires to go to the place that Jehovah chooses, <input type='hidden' value='18:6'>7&nbsp;he may minister there in the name of Jehovah his God the same as all his brothers, the Levites, who are stationed there before Jehovah. <input type='hidden' value='18:7'>8&nbsp;He will receive an equal share of food with them, in addition to what he receives from selling his ancestral possessions.

9&nbsp;&ldquo;When you have entered into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the detestable practices of those nations. <input type='hidden' value='18:9'>10&nbsp;There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, anyone practicing magic, anyone who looks for omens, a sorcerer, <input type='hidden' value='18:10'><a id='c18v11' href='#recherchec18v11'>11</a>&nbsp;anyone binding others with a spell, anyone who consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller, or anyone who inquires of the dead. <input type='hidden' value='18:11'>12&nbsp;For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable practices Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you. <input type='hidden' value='18:12'>13&nbsp;You should prove yourself blameless before Jehovah your God.
<input type='hidden' value='18:13'><br><br>

<div id='recherchec17v7'><b><a href='#c17v7'>17:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 787</b> : EXPELLING<br><br><b>it-2 234</b> : One who proved to be a false witness received the punishment that the person accused would have received if found guilty. (De 19:17-21) Witnesses in all capital convictions were required to throw the first stone in the execution of the convicted one. Thus witnesses were enjoined by law to demonstrate their zeal for true, clean worship and for clearing out what was bad in Israel. This would also act as a deterrent to false testimony. It would take a very callous person to make a false accusation, knowing that he had to be the first to act in putting the accused to death.&mdash;De 17:7. <br><br><b>1037</b> : Before a wrongdoer could be stoned, at least two witnesses had to give harmonious testimony against him, and thereafter they cast the first stones. (Le 24:14;&nbsp;De 17:6,&nbsp;7) The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent to false testimony, which, if discovered, would cost the lying witness his own life.&mdash;De 19:18-20. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec17v16'><b><a href='#c17v16'>17:16 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 427</b> : In Israel no sizable national chariot force developed until the time of Solomon. This was due in large measure to God&rsquo;s warning that the king was not to multiply horses, as if the nation&rsquo;s security depended on them. This restriction limited the use of chariots, since horses were used to power such vehicles. (De 17:16) <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec17v18'><b><a href='#c17v18'>17:18 </a></b> <br><b>w07 3/15 20</b> : The third example concerns Israel&rsquo;s priests. The Encyclopaedia Judaica argues that their &ldquo;religious and secular functions demanded that they be literate.&rdquo; For instance, Moses commanded the sons of Levi: &ldquo;At the end of every seven years, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you will read this law in front of all Israel.&rdquo; The priests became caretakers of the official copy of the Law. They authorized and supervised the writing of subsequent copies.&mdash;Deuteronomy 17:18, 19;&nbsp;31:10,&nbsp;11. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec17v19'><b><a href='#c17v19'>17:19 </a></b> <br><b>w02 6/15 12-17</b> : YOU may hardly think of yourself as a king or a queen. What faithful Christian and student of the Bible would imagine himself or herself acting with royal authority, like good Kings David, Josiah, Hezekiah, or Jehoshaphat? Yet, you can and should be like them in at least one special way. What is that? And why should you want to be like them in that regard? 2 In Moses&rsquo; day, long before God approved of a human king for the Israelites, He foresaw that the desire to have a king would arise among His people. Therefore he inspired Moses to include relevant instructions in the Law covenant. These were royal instructions, directions for a king. 3 God said: &ldquo;When you eventually come into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you have said, &lsquo;Let me set a king over myself like all the nations who are round about me&rsquo;; you should without fail set over yourself a king whom Jehovah your God will choose. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it must occur that when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it must continue with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them.&rdquo;&mdash;Deuteronomy 17:14-19. 4 Yes, the king that Jehovah would choose for his worshipers was to make a personal copy of writings that you can find in your Bible. Then the king was to read in that copy daily, repeatedly. That was not a memory exercise. It was study, and it had a beneficial objective. The king who would have Jehovah&rsquo;s approval needed to pursue such study to develop and retain the right heart attitude. He also needed to study those inspired writings to be a successful, insightful king.&mdash;2&nbsp;Kings 22:8-13;&nbsp;Proverbs 1:1-4. 5 What do you think that would have entailed for David when he became king over Israel? Well, he would have had to make a copy of the books of the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). Think of what an impression it must have made on David&rsquo;s mind and heart to use his own eyes and hands to write out a copy of the Law. Likely, Moses also penned the book of Job as well as Psalms 90 and&nbsp;91. Would David have copied these too? Perhaps. Also, he would probably have had available the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. So you can see that King David would have had a good part of the Bible to read and absorb. And you have reason to believe that he did just that, for note his comments about God&rsquo;s Law, now found at Psalm 19:7-11. 6 The Greater David&mdash;Jesus, the Son of David&mdash;followed a similar pattern. It was Jesus&rsquo; custom to go to the local synagogue weekly. There he heard the Scriptures read and commented on. More than that, on occasion Jesus himself publicly read aloud from God&rsquo;s Word and explained its application. (Luke 4:16-21) You can easily get a sense of his familiarity with the Scriptures. Just read the Gospel accounts, and note how often Jesus said &ldquo;it is written&rdquo; or in other ways referred to specific passages of Scripture. Why, in his Sermon on the Mount as recorded by Matthew, Jesus quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures 21 times.&mdash;Matthew 4:4-10;&nbsp;7:29;&nbsp;11:10;&nbsp;21:13;&nbsp;26:24,&nbsp;31;&nbsp;John 6:31,&nbsp;45;&nbsp;8:17. 7 Jesus followed the counsel at Psalm 1:1-3: &ldquo;Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Everything he does will succeed.&rdquo; How that contrasted with the religious leaders of his day, who had &ldquo;seated themselves in the seat of Moses&rdquo; but who ignored &ldquo;the law of Jehovah&rdquo;!&mdash;Matthew 23:2-4. 8 Some might be puzzled, however, by one passage that could be interpreted as though Jesus were discouraging the study of the Bible. At John 5:39, 40, we read what Jesus said to some in his day: &ldquo;You are searching the Scriptures, because you think that by means of them you will have everlasting life; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me. And yet you do not want to come to me that you may have life.&rdquo; By that comment Jesus was not discouraging his Jewish listeners from studying the Scriptures. Rather, he was showing up their insincerity or their inconsistency. They realized that the Scriptures could guide them to everlasting life, but the very Scriptures that they were searching also should have led them to the Messiah, Jesus. Nonetheless, they refused to accept him. Studying was thus of no profit because they were not sincere, teachable.&mdash;Deuteronomy 18:15;&nbsp;Luke 11:52;&nbsp;John 7:47,&nbsp;48. 9 How different the picture was with Jesus&rsquo; disciples, including the apostles! They studied &ldquo;the holy writings, which are able to make [one] wise for salvation.&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Timothy 3:15) In this they were like the earlier prophets who made &ldquo;a diligent inquiry and a careful search.&rdquo; Those prophets did not consider that search to be just one zealous burst of study for a few months or a year. The apostle Peter says that &ldquo;they kept on investigating,&rdquo; particularly about the Christ and what glories were involved in his saving role for mankind. In his first letter, Peter 34 times quoted from ten Bible books.&mdash;1&nbsp;Peter 1:10,&nbsp;11. 10 Clearly, then, careful study of God&rsquo;s Word was a royal assignment for the kings in ancient Israel. Jesus followed this pattern. And studying it was an undertaking for those who would rule with Christ as kings in heaven. (Luke 22:28-30;&nbsp;Romans 8:17;&nbsp;2&nbsp;Timothy 2:12;&nbsp;Revelation 5:10;&nbsp;20:6) This royal pattern is just as necessary for all today who look forward to blessings on earth under Kingdom rule.&mdash;Matthew 25:34,&nbsp;46. 11 We can emphatically and honestly say that each true Christian should be making his or her own examination of the Bible. That is not something needed merely when you first study the Bible with Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. Each of us ought to be resolved to avoid being like some in the apostle Paul&rsquo;s day who in time slacked off in personal study. They learned &ldquo;the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;the primary doctrine about the Christ.&rdquo; Yet, they did not keep up their studying and thus did not &ldquo;press on to maturity.&rdquo; (Hebrews 5:12&ndash;6:3) We can accordingly ask ourselves: &lsquo;How do I feel about personal study of God&rsquo;s Word, whether I have been associated with the Christian congregation for a short while or for decades? Paul prayed that Christians in his day keep &ldquo;increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.&rdquo; Do I show that I have the same desire?&rsquo;&mdash;Colossians 1:9,&nbsp;10. 12 A key to your having good study habits is that you develop a fondness for God&rsquo;s Word. Psalm 119:14-16 points to regular, purposeful reflection upon God&rsquo;s Word as a means by which you come to take delight in it. Again, that is true no matter how long you have been a Christian. Underscoring that, recall the example of Timothy. Though this Christian elder was already serving as &ldquo;a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,&rdquo; Paul urged him to do his utmost in &ldquo;handling the word of the truth aright.&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Timothy 2:3,&nbsp;15;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Timothy 4:15) Clearly, doing your &ldquo;utmost&rdquo; involves having good study habits. 13 A step toward good study habits is regularly to set aside time for Bible study. How have you been doing in that regard? Whatever your honest response is, do you think that you would benefit from spending more time in personal study? &lsquo;How,&rsquo; you may wonder, &lsquo;could I arrange time for that?&rsquo; Well, some have increased their effective Bible study time by getting up a bit earlier in the morning. They might read the Bible for 15 minutes or work on a personal study project. As another possibility, what about making a slight adjustment in your weekly schedule? For example, if you are in the habit of reading the newspaper most days or watching the evening news on television, would it be possible to skip doing that just one day a week? You could use the time on that day for increased Bible study. If you replaced the news one day and devoted a time slot of 30 minutes or so to personal study, you would gain over 25 hours a year. Imagine the benefits of 25 hours of additional Bible reading or study! Here is another idea: Over the course of the coming week, analyze your activities at the end of each day. See if you can find something that could be omitted or curtailed to allow time for more Bible reading or study.&mdash;Ephesians 5:15,&nbsp;16. 14 What will make studying easier for you, more appealing? Goals. What realistic study goals could you set? For many, an admirable first goal is that of reading the entire Bible. Perhaps up till now, you have read sections of the Bible on occasion and have benefited from it. Could you now make it your determination to read the entire Bible? Your initial goal to that end might be to read the four Gospels, followed by an intermediate goal, such as then reading the rest of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Once you have the resulting satisfaction and benefits, your next goal might be a progressive reading of the books of Moses and the historical books through Esther. Accomplishing that, you will see it is realistic to complete the rest of the Bible. One woman, who was about 65 years old when she became a Christian, wrote on the inside cover of her Bible the date when she began to read it through and later the date when she finished it. She now has five pairs of dates! (Deuteronomy 32:45-47) And rather than read from a computer screen or printout, she had the Bible in her hands. 15 Some who have already met the goal of reading the whole Bible take other steps to make their ongoing study increasingly productive and rewarding. One way is to include selected study material prior to reading each successive Bible book. In &ldquo;All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&rdquo; and Insight on the Scriptures, one can find excellent information about the historical setting, style, and potential benefits of each Bible book. 16 During your study, avoid the approach common to many so-called Bible scholars. They focus excessively on analyzing texts as if the Bible were of human origin. Some of them try to fix a distinct audience for each book or to conjure up an objective and supposed viewpoint that a human author of each book had in mind. The effect of such human reasoning may be that of relegating Bible books to mere history or viewing them as reflecting evolutionary approaches to religion. Other scholars give themselves over to word studies, like the philology of Bible literature. They get more involved in studying word origins and citing Hebrew and Greek meanings than in the import of God&rsquo;s message. Do you think that such approaches are likely to impart deep and motivating faith?&mdash;1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:13. 17 Are the scholars&rsquo; conclusions even valid? Is it true that each Bible book has but one key point or is intended for one audience exclusively? (1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:19-21) The fact is that the books of God&rsquo;s Word have permanent value for people of all ages and backgrounds. Even if a book was initially addressed to one person, such as Timothy or Titus, or to a particular group, perhaps the Galatians or the Philippians, all of us can and should study those books. They are important for every one of us, and a given book may treat many themes and benefit many audiences. Yes, the message of the Bible is universal, which helps us to understand why it has been translated into the tongues of people around the globe.&mdash;Romans 15:4. 18 As you study, you will find it very profitable to seek an understanding of the Bible as well as to try to see details in their right relationships. (Proverbs 2:3-5;&nbsp;4:7) What Jehovah has revealed through his Word is intimately connected to his purpose. So as you read, relate the facts and counsel to that. You might ponder how an incident, idea, or prophecy relates to Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose. Ask yourself: &lsquo;What does this tell me about Jehovah? How does it bear on God&rsquo;s purpose being carried out through his Kingdom?&rsquo; You might also reflect: &lsquo;How can I use this information? Can I employ it in teaching or advising others based on the Scriptures?&rsquo;&mdash;Joshua 1:8. 19 Thinking of others is of benefit in another respect too. In the process of your Bible reading and study, you will learn new things and gain new insights. Try to include these in upbuilding conversation with your family members or others. If you do so at appropriate times and in a modest way, such discussions unquestionably will be rewarding. Your sincere, enthusiastic recounting of what you gained or the aspects you found interesting will likely make such more impressive to others. More than that, it will be of profit to you personally. In what way? Experts have noted that a person will longer remember what he has learned or covered if while it is fresh in his mind, he uses or repeats it, as when relating it to others. 20 Each time you read through a Bible book, you certainly will glean new information. You will be struck by passages that previously did not say as much to you. They will take on new meaning. This should underscore that rather than being mere human literature, the books of the Bible are treasures fit for your repeated study and benefit. Remember, a king, such as David, was to &ldquo;read in it all the days of his life.&rdquo; 21 Yes, those who take the time for deep study of the Bible profit immensely. They gain spiritual gems and insights. Their relationship with God becomes stronger, richer. They also become an increasingly valuable asset to family members, to brothers and sisters in the Christian congregation, and to those who have yet to become worshipers of Jehovah.&mdash;Romans 10:9-14;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Timothy 4:16. <br><br><b>w00 10/1 8-9</b> : 3 Speaking in anticipation of the time when the nation of Israel would have a human king, Jehovah said: &ldquo;It must occur that when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law from that which is in the charge of the priests, the Levites. And it must continue with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them; that his heart may not exalt itself above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left.&rdquo;&mdash;Deuteronomy 17:18-20. 4 Notice the reasons why Jehovah required all future kings of Israel to read the book of divine law daily: (1)&nbsp;&ldquo;in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them&rdquo;; (2)&nbsp;&ldquo;that his heart may not exalt itself above his brothers&rdquo;; (3)&nbsp;&ldquo;that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left.&rdquo; Do not Christian overseers today need to fear Jehovah, obey his laws, refrain from exalting themselves above their brothers, and avoid deviating from Jehovah&rsquo;s commandments? Daily Bible reading is surely no less important for them than it was for the kings of Israel. <br><br><b>it-2 755</b> : The kings of Israel were under divine command to write for themselves copies of God&rsquo;s law and to read it daily. (De 17:18, 19; see MEDITATION.) Their failure to heed this command contributed to the neglect of true worship in the land, resulting in the demoralization of the people, which led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 607&nbsp;B.C.E. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec18v11'><b><a href='#c18v11'>18:11 </a></b> <br><b>g 6/12 10-11</b> : The Bible&rsquo;s Viewpoint<br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec18v15'><b><a href='#c18v15'>18:15 </a></b> <br><b>w09 4/15 24-28</b> : 6 Shortly after Pentecost 33&nbsp;C.E., the apostle Peter quoted a prophecy by Moses that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Peter was standing before a crowd of worshippers in the temple. The people were &ldquo;surprised out of their wits&rdquo; when Peter and John healed a beggar who was lame from birth, and they all ran to investigate. Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah&rsquo;s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ. Then, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures, he said: &ldquo;In fact, Moses said, &lsquo;Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 3:11,&nbsp;22, 23; read Deuteronomy 18:15,&nbsp;18,&nbsp;19. 7 Those words of Moses were likely familiar to Peter&rsquo;s audience. As Jews, they had a high regard for Moses. (Deut. 34:10) With keen anticipation, they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses. That prophet would prove to be not just a messiah, an anointed one of God like Moses, but the Messiah, &ldquo;the Christ of God, the Chosen One&rdquo; of Jehovah.&mdash;Luke 23:35;&nbsp;Heb. 11:26. 8 In some respects, the earthly life of Jesus resembled the life of Moses. For instance, as babes, both Moses and Jesus escaped death at the hands of a tyrannical ruler. (Ex. 1:22&ndash;2:10;&nbsp;Matt. 2:7-14) In addition, both were &lsquo;called out of Egypt.&rsquo; The prophet Hosea stated: &ldquo;When Israel was a boy, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&rdquo; (Hos. 11:1) Hosea&rsquo;s words pointed back to the time when the nation of Israel, under its divinely appointed leader, Moses, was led out of Egypt. (Ex. 4:22, 23;&nbsp;12:29-37) However, Hosea&rsquo;s words referred not only to a past event but also to a future one. His words were a prophecy that was fulfilled when Joseph and Mary returned from Egypt with Jesus after the death of King Herod.&mdash;Matt. 2:15,&nbsp;19-23. 9 Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah&rsquo;s backing. Indeed, Moses was the first human on record to perform miracles. (Ex. 4:1-9) For example, Moses performed miracles involving water when at his command the waters of the Nile and its reedy pools became blood, the Red Sea was parted, and water came gushing out of rock in the desert. (Ex. 7:19-21;&nbsp;14:21;&nbsp;17:5-7) Jesus too performed miracles involving water. His very first miracle was that of turning water into wine at a wedding feast. (John 2:1-11) Later, he calmed the turbulent Sea of Galilee. And on one occasion, he even walked on water! (Matt. 8:23-27;&nbsp;14:23-25) Some other similarities between Moses and the Greater Moses, Jesus, can be seen in the box on page&nbsp;26. 10 Most people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but that is only part of a prophet&rsquo;s responsibility. A true prophet is an inspired spokesman for Jehovah, one who proclaims &ldquo;the magnificent things of God.&rdquo; (Acts 2:11,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;17) Among other things, his prophesying could include announcing future events, revealing aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose, or proclaiming God&rsquo;s judgments. Moses was such a prophet. He foretold each of the Ten Plagues that befell Egypt. He introduced the Law covenant at Sinai. And he instructed the nation in God&rsquo;s will. Yet, a prophet greater than Moses was to come eventually. 11 Later, in the first century, Zechariah acted as a prophet in revealing God&rsquo;s purpose regarding his son, John. (Luke 1:76) That son became John the Baptizer, who announced the coming of the long-awaited prophet greater than Moses&mdash;Jesus Christ. (John 1:23-36) As a prophet, Jesus foretold many things. For example, he spoke about his own death, foretelling how he would die, where he would die, and at whose hands he would die. (Matt. 20:17-19) To the surprise of his listeners, Jesus also foretold the destruction of Jerusalem with its temple. (Mark 13:1,&nbsp;2) His prophecies reach right down to our own time.&mdash;Matt. 24:3-41. 12 In addition to being a prophet, Jesus was a preacher and a teacher. He preached the good news of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and no one spoke with greater boldness than he did. (Luke 4:16-21,&nbsp;43) As a teacher, he had no equal. &ldquo;Never has another man spoken like this,&rdquo; said some who heard him. (John 7:46) Jesus was zealous in his efforts to spread the good news, and he inspired his followers with that same zeal for the Kingdom. Thus, he laid the foundation for a global preaching and teaching campaign that is still continuing. (Matt. 28:18-20;&nbsp;Acts 5:42) Last year, some seven million of Christ&rsquo;s followers spent about 1,500,000,000 hours in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching interested ones Bible truths. Do you have a meaningful share in that work? 13 There is no question that Jehovah fulfilled the prophecy to raise up a prophet like Moses. How does that knowledge affect you? Does it give you more confidence in the fulfillment of inspired prophecies that have to do with our immediate future? Yes, meditating on the example of the Greater Moses moves us to &ldquo;stay awake and keep our senses&rdquo; as to what God will soon do.&mdash;1&nbsp;Thess. 5:2,&nbsp;6. 14 Like Moses, Jesus was a mediator. A mediator acts as a bridge between two parties. Moses mediated the Law covenant between Jehovah and the Israelites. If the sons of Jacob obeyed the laws of God, they would remain God&rsquo;s special property, his congregation. (Ex. 19:3-8) That covenant stayed in force from 1513&nbsp;B.C.E. until the first century C.E. 15 In 33&nbsp;C.E., Jehovah initiated a better covenant with a new Israel, &ldquo;the Israel of God,&rdquo; which became a worldwide congregation made up of anointed Christians. (Gal. 6:16) While the covenant mediated by Moses included laws written by God on stone, the covenant mediated by Jesus is superior. Its laws are inscribed by God on human hearts. (Read 1&nbsp;Timothy 2:5;&nbsp;Hebrews 8:10.) Thus, &ldquo;the Israel of God&rdquo; is now God&rsquo;s special property, &lsquo;a nation producing the fruits&rsquo; of the Messianic Kingdom. (Matt. 21:43) Members of that spiritual nation are the participants in that new covenant. Still, they are not the only ones to benefit from it. Untold multitudes, even many who at present are asleep in death, will receive everlasting blessings because of that superlative covenant. 16 On their last night before the Exodus, some of the offspring of Israel were in grave danger. Soon, God&rsquo;s angel would pass through the land of Egypt, killing all the firstborn. Jehovah told Moses that the firstborn of Israel would be saved if the Israelites took the blood of the Passover lamb and sprinkled it on the lintels and doorposts of their doorways. (Ex. 12:1-13,&nbsp;21-23) So it proved to be. Later, the whole nation was in serious danger. They were trapped between the Red Sea and the pursuing Egyptian war chariots. Jehovah again provided deliverance through Moses, who miraculously parted the waters of that sea.&mdash;Ex. 14:13,&nbsp;21. 17 Great as those acts of deliverance were, the deliverance Jehovah performed through Jesus is much greater. Jesus is the means by which obedient ones are delivered from slavery to sin. (Rom. 5:12,&nbsp;18) And that deliverance is &ldquo;an everlasting deliverance.&rdquo; (Heb. 9:11,&nbsp;12) The name Jesus means &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; Jesus, as our Deliverer, or Savior, not only rescues us from our past sins but also opens the way for us to enjoy a better future. By delivering them from slavery to sin, Jesus saves his followers from the wrath of God and brings them into a loving relationship with Jehovah.&mdash;Matt. 1:21. 18 The deliverance from sin that Jesus provides will in due time include freedom from its grim effects&mdash;sickness and even death. To visualize what that will mean, consider what happened when Jesus went to the home of a certain man named Jairus, whose 12-year-old daughter had died. Jesus reassured Jairus: &ldquo;Have no fear, only put forth faith, and she will be saved.&rdquo; (Luke 8:41, 42,&nbsp;49,&nbsp;50) True to his words, the girl rose from the dead! Can you imagine the joy of her parents? Then you have an idea of the surpassing joy that will be ours when &ldquo;all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus&rsquo;] voice and come out&rdquo; in the resurrection. (John 5:28,&nbsp;29) Truly, Jesus is a Savior, our Deliverer!&mdash;Read Acts 5:31;&nbsp;Titus 1:4;&nbsp;Rev. 7:10. 19 Knowing that we can be instrumental in helping people to benefit from Jesus&rsquo; saving acts impels us to share in the preaching and teaching work. (Isa. 61:1-3) Further, meditating on Jesus&rsquo; role as the Greater Moses deepens our confidence that he will deliver his followers when he comes to execute judgment upon the wicked.&mdash;Matt. 25:31-34,&nbsp;41,&nbsp;46;&nbsp;Rev. 7:9,&nbsp;14. 20 Yes, Jesus is the Greater Moses. He did many marvelous things that Moses could never have done. Jesus&rsquo; words as a prophet and his actions as a mediator affect the entire human family. As a Deliverer, Jesus brings not temporary but eternal salvation for redeemable mankind. <br><br><b>g04 4/8 12-13</b> : We live in distressing times. Mankind certainly needs a leader like Moses&mdash;someone who has not only power and authority but also integrity, courage, compassion, and a heartfelt love of justice. When Moses died, the Israelites must have wondered, &lsquo;Will the world see the likes of him again?&rsquo; Moses himself answered that question. Moses&rsquo; writings explain how sickness and death came about in the first place and why God permitted wickedness to continue. (Genesis 3:1-19;&nbsp;Job, chapters&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2) At Genesis 3:15, the very first divine prophecy is recorded&mdash;a promise that evil will eventually be crushed! How? The prophecy indicated that an individual would be born through whom salvation would come. This promise gave birth to the hope that a Messiah would arise and deliver mankind. But who would the Messiah be? Moses helps us to identify him conclusively. Toward the end of his life, Moses uttered these portentous words: &ldquo;A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you&mdash;to him you people should listen.&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 18:15) The apostle Peter later applied those words directly to Jesus.&mdash;Acts 3:20-26. Most Jewish commentators vigorously deny any comparison of Moses with Jesus. They argue that the words of this text apply to any true prophet who came after Moses. However, according to Tanakh&mdash;The Holy Scriptures, by the Jewish Publication Society, Deuteronomy 34:10 says: &ldquo;Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses&mdash;whom the LORD singled out, face to face.&rdquo; Yes, many faithful prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, came after Moses. But none had the unique relationship with God that Moses enjoyed&mdash;speaking with him &ldquo;face to face.&rdquo; Moses&rsquo; promise of a prophet &lsquo;like him&rsquo; must therefore apply to one individual&mdash;the Messiah! It is noteworthy that before the advent of Christianity&mdash;and religious persecution from false Christians&mdash;Jewish scholars viewed things similarly. Echoes of this can be seen in Jewish writings, such as the Midrash Rabbah, which describes Moses as the forerunner of the &ldquo;latter Redeemer,&rdquo; or Messiah. That Jesus was like Moses in many ways cannot be denied. (See the box &ldquo;Jesus&mdash;A Prophet Like Moses.&rdquo;) Jesus has power and authority. (Matthew 28:19) Jesus is &ldquo;mild-tempered and lowly in heart.&rdquo; (Matthew 11:29) Jesus hates lawlessness and injustice. (Hebrews 1:9) He can therefore give us the leadership we sorely need! It is he who will soon crush wickedness and bring the earth to the Paradise conditions that the Bible describes. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec18v18'><b><a href='#c18v18'>18:18 </a></b> <br><b>w09 4/15 24-28</b> : 6 Shortly after Pentecost 33&nbsp;C.E., the apostle Peter quoted a prophecy by Moses that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Peter was standing before a crowd of worshippers in the temple. The people were &ldquo;surprised out of their wits&rdquo; when Peter and John healed a beggar who was lame from birth, and they all ran to investigate. Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah&rsquo;s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ. Then, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures, he said: &ldquo;In fact, Moses said, &lsquo;Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 3:11,&nbsp;22, 23; read Deuteronomy 18:15,&nbsp;18,&nbsp;19. 7 Those words of Moses were likely familiar to Peter&rsquo;s audience. As Jews, they had a high regard for Moses. (Deut. 34:10) With keen anticipation, they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses. That prophet would prove to be not just a messiah, an anointed one of God like Moses, but the Messiah, &ldquo;the Christ of God, the Chosen One&rdquo; of Jehovah.&mdash;Luke 23:35;&nbsp;Heb. 11:26. 8 In some respects, the earthly life of Jesus resembled the life of Moses. For instance, as babes, both Moses and Jesus escaped death at the hands of a tyrannical ruler. (Ex. 1:22&ndash;2:10;&nbsp;Matt. 2:7-14) In addition, both were &lsquo;called out of Egypt.&rsquo; The prophet Hosea stated: &ldquo;When Israel was a boy, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&rdquo; (Hos. 11:1) Hosea&rsquo;s words pointed back to the time when the nation of Israel, under its divinely appointed leader, Moses, was led out of Egypt. (Ex. 4:22, 23;&nbsp;12:29-37) However, Hosea&rsquo;s words referred not only to a past event but also to a future one. His words were a prophecy that was fulfilled when Joseph and Mary returned from Egypt with Jesus after the death of King Herod.&mdash;Matt. 2:15,&nbsp;19-23. 9 Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah&rsquo;s backing. Indeed, Moses was the first human on record to perform miracles. (Ex. 4:1-9) For example, Moses performed miracles involving water when at his command the waters of the Nile and its reedy pools became blood, the Red Sea was parted, and water came gushing out of rock in the desert. (Ex. 7:19-21;&nbsp;14:21;&nbsp;17:5-7) Jesus too performed miracles involving water. His very first miracle was that of turning water into wine at a wedding feast. (John 2:1-11) Later, he calmed the turbulent Sea of Galilee. And on one occasion, he even walked on water! (Matt. 8:23-27;&nbsp;14:23-25) Some other similarities between Moses and the Greater Moses, Jesus, can be seen in the box on page&nbsp;26. 10 Most people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but that is only part of a prophet&rsquo;s responsibility. A true prophet is an inspired spokesman for Jehovah, one who proclaims &ldquo;the magnificent things of God.&rdquo; (Acts 2:11,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;17) Among other things, his prophesying could include announcing future events, revealing aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose, or proclaiming God&rsquo;s judgments.

As you can imagine, some people might be drawn by cures and miraculously provided food. (Matthew 4:24, 25;&nbsp;8:16;&nbsp;9:32, 33;&nbsp;14:35, 36;&nbsp;John 6:26) Beyond being of physical help, however, those works actually moved observers to recognize that Jesus was the Son of God and &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; that Moses had foretold.&mdash;John 6:14;&nbsp;Deuteronomy 18:15. 13 Why was it significant that Jesus was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo;? Well, what was the key role foretold for that one? Was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; to be famous for performing miraculous healings or compassionately producing food for the hungry? Deuteronomy 18:18 predicted: &ldquo;A prophet I shall raise up for them from the midst of their brothers, like you [Moses]; and I shall indeed put my words in his mouth, and he will certainly speak to them all that I shall command him.&rdquo; <br><br><b>it-2 386</b> : A prophet who would perform many signs.

In many ways there was pictorial correspondency between these two great prophets, Moses and Jesus Christ. In infancy both escaped the wholesale slaughter ordered by the respective rulers of their time. (Ex 1:22;&nbsp;2:1-10;&nbsp;Mt 2:13-18) Moses was called out of Egypt with Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;firstborn,&rdquo; the nation of Israel, Moses being the nation&rsquo;s leader. Jesus was called out of Egypt as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. (Ex 4:22, 23;&nbsp;Ho 11:1;&nbsp;Mt 2:15,&nbsp;19-21) Both fasted for 40 days in wilderness places. (Ex 34:28;&nbsp;Mt 4:1,&nbsp;2) Both came in the name of Jehovah, Jesus&rsquo; name itself meaning &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; (Ex 3:13-16;&nbsp;Mt 1:21;&nbsp;Joh 5:43) Jesus, like Moses, &lsquo;declared the name of Jehovah.&rsquo; (De 32:3;&nbsp;Joh 17:6,&nbsp;26) Both were exceptional in meekness and humility. (Nu 12:3;&nbsp;Mt 11:28-30) Both had the most convincing credentials to show that they were sent by God&mdash;astounding miracles of many sorts, Jesus Christ going farther than Moses by raising dead persons to life.&mdash;Ex 14:21-31;&nbsp;Ps 78:12-54;&nbsp;Mt 11:5;&nbsp;Mr 5:38-43;&nbsp;Lu 7:11-15,&nbsp;18-23. Moses was mediator of the Law covenant between God and the nation of Israel. Jesus was Mediator of the new covenant between God and the &ldquo;holy nation,&rdquo; the spiritual &ldquo;Israel of God.&rdquo; (1Pe 2:9;&nbsp;Ga 6:16;&nbsp;Ex 19:3-9;&nbsp;Lu 22:20;&nbsp;Heb 8:6;&nbsp;9:15) Both served as judges, lawgivers, and leaders. (Ex 18:13;&nbsp;32:34;&nbsp;Da 9:25;&nbsp;Mal 4:4;&nbsp;Mt 23:10;&nbsp;Joh 5:22, 23;&nbsp;13:34;&nbsp;15:10) Moses was entrusted with and proved faithful to his stewardship in the &lsquo;house of God,&rsquo; that is, the nation, or congregation, of Israel. Jesus showed faithfulness over God&rsquo;s house that he as God&rsquo;s Son constructed, namely, the nation, or congregation, of spiritual Israel. (Nu 12:7;&nbsp;Heb 3:2-6) And even in death there was a parallel: God disposed of the bodies of both Moses and Jesus.&mdash;De 34:5,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;Ac 2:31;&nbsp;Jude&nbsp;9. Toward the end of Moses&rsquo; 40-year sojourn in the wilderness, while he was shepherding his father-in-law&rsquo;s flock, God&rsquo;s angel made a miraculous manifestation to him in the flame of a thornbush at the foot of Mount Horeb. Jehovah there commissioned him to deliver His people from Egypt. (Ex 3:1-15) Thus God appointed Moses as His prophet and representative, and Moses could now correctly be called an anointed one, or &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; In order to come into that privileged position, Moses had had to give up &ldquo;the treasures of Egypt&rdquo; and let himself &ldquo;be ill-treated with the people of God&rdquo; and thus suffer reproach. But to Moses such &ldquo;reproach of the Christ&rdquo; was riches greater than all of Egypt&rsquo;s wealth.&mdash;Heb 11:24-26. A parallel to this is found in Jesus Christ. According to the angel&rsquo;s announcement at his birth in Bethlehem, he was to become &ldquo;a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; He became Christ, or Anointed One, after the prophet John baptized him in the Jordan River. (Lu 2:10, 11;&nbsp;3:21-23;&nbsp;4:16-21) Thereafter he acknowledged that he was &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; or Messiah. (Mt 16:16, 17;&nbsp;Mr 14:61, 62;&nbsp;Joh 4:25,&nbsp;26) Jesus Christ also kept his eye on the prize and despised the shame that men heaped upon him, as Moses had done. (Php 2:8,&nbsp;9;&nbsp;Heb 12:2) It is into this Greater Moses that the Christian congregation is baptized&mdash;into Jesus Christ, the foretold Prophet, Liberator, and Leader.&mdash;1Co 10:1,&nbsp;2. <br><br><b>697</b> : PROPHET<br></div><br><br>
