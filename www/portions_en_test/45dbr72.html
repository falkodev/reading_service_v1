<div id='recherchec14v21'><b><a href='#c14v21'>14:21 </a></b> <br><b>w05 7/1 27</b> : There is no contradiction between these two verses. The first text repeats the prohibition against eating an animal found dead, perhaps one that was killed by wild beasts. (Exodus 22:31;&nbsp;Leviticus 22:8) The second explains what an Israelite might have done if he violated that prohibition, possibly by accident. The fact that something was prohibited by the Law did not mean that the prohibition would not at some time be ignored. For example, there were laws against stealing, murder, bearing false witness, and so forth. At the same time, there were penalties for breaking those divinely given laws. Such penalties gave force to the laws and showed how serious they were. A person who transgressed the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal found dead would be unclean in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes and would have to undergo the proper procedure for cleansing. If he failed to cleanse himself properly, he would have to &ldquo;answer for his error.&rdquo;&mdash;Leviticus 17:15,&nbsp;16. <br><br><b>w04 9/15 26</b> : 14:21&mdash;Why could the Israelites give to an alien resident or sell to a foreigner an unbled dead animal that they themselves would not eat? In the Bible, the term &ldquo;alien resident&rdquo; could refer to a non-Israelite who became a proselyte or to a settler who lived by basic laws of the land but who did not become a worshiper of Jehovah. A foreigner and an alien resident who did not become proselytes were not under the Law and could use unbled dead animals in various ways. The Israelites were permitted to give or sell such animals to them. The proselyte, on the other hand, was bound by the Law covenant. As indicated at Leviticus 17:10, such a person was forbidden to eat the blood of an animal. <br><br><b>it-1 73</b> : The alien resident who could be given the body of an animal that had died of itself was evidently one who had not become a full-fledged worshiper of Jehovah.&mdash;De 14:21. <br><br><b>345</b> : At Deuteronomy 14:21 allowance was made for selling to an alien resident or a foreigner an animal that had died of itself or that had been torn by a beast. Thus a distinction was made between the blood of such animals and that of animals that a person slaughtered for food. (Compare Le 17:14-16.) The Israelites, as well as alien residents who took up true worship and came under the Law covenant, were obligated to live up to the lofty requirements of that Law. People of all nations were bound by the requirement at Genesis 9:3, 4, but those under the Law were held by God to a higher standard in adhering to that requirement than were foreigners and alien residents who had not become worshipers of Jehovah. <br><br><b>it-2 402</b> : Boiling a kid in its mother&rsquo;s milk was prohibited under the Mosaic Law. (De 14:21) This prohibition is mentioned twice in connection with the giving of one&rsquo;s firstfruits to Jehovah.&mdash;Ex 23:19;&nbsp;34:26. It has been theorized that this practice had pagan, idolatrous, or magical connections. However, the evidence to support this view is not sound at present. Another suggestion is that this statute emphasizes that there is a proper and fitting order in matters that should be adhered to. God provided the milk of the mother for the purpose of nourishing her young. To use it to boil her offspring to prepare it to be eaten would be to the kid&rsquo;s harm and the opposite of what God had in mind when making provision for such milk. A third possibility is that this command was given in order to encourage compassion. This would be in harmony with other commands that prohibited sacrificing an animal if it had not first been with its mother for at least seven days (Le 22:27), slaughtering both an animal and its offspring on the same day (Le 22:28), or taking from a nest both a mother and its eggs or offspring (De 22:6,&nbsp;7). <br></div><br>

However, in case the journey to the festival place was too far, the Law provided that such goods could be turned into money; then this money could be used to buy food and drink for use while at the sanctuary. (De 14:22-27) <br><br><b>it-2 1110</b> : It seems there was an additional tithe, a second tenth, set aside each year for purposes other than the direct support of the Levitical priesthood, though the Levites shared in it.

In cases where the distance to Jerusalem was too great for the convenient transport of this tithe, then the produce was converted into money and this, in turn, was used in Jerusalem for the household&rsquo;s sustenance and enjoyment during the holy convention there. (De 12:4-7,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;17, 18;&nbsp;14:22-27) Then, at the end of every third and sixth years of the seven-year sabbatical cycle, this tithe, instead of being used to defray expenses at the national assemblies, was set aside for the Levites, alien residents, widows, and fatherless boys in the local community.&mdash;De 14:28, 29;&nbsp;26:12. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec14v26'><b><a href='#c14v26'>14:26 </a></b> <br><b>w10 2/1 23</b> : In fact, the term &ldquo;intoxicating liquor&rdquo; could also refer to beer. The Hebrew word translated &ldquo;intoxicating liquor&rdquo; is related to an Akkadian word that can refer to the common barley beer of Mesopotamia. That beverage was low in alcohol but potentially intoxicating if drunk in excess. (Proverbs 20:1) Clay models of breweries and paintings of brewers have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. In Babylon, beer was an everyday drink both in palaces and in the homes of the poor. The Philistines enjoyed a similar brew. Throughout Palestine, archaeologists have found jugs equipped with strainer spouts. Those vessels strained the beer, preventing drinkers from swallowing husks of the barley from which it was brewed. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v1'><b><a href='#c15v1'>15:1 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : The seventh in each cycle of seven years; during this year, in ancient Israel the land was allowed to rest, lying uncultivated, and fellow Hebrews were not pressed for payment of debts. Counting from 1473&nbsp;B.C.E., the year that Israel entered the Promised Land, a sabbath year was to be celebrated &ldquo;at the end of every seven years,&rdquo; actually on every seventh year. (De 15:1, 2,&nbsp;12; compare De 14:28.) The Sabbath year evidently began with the trumpet blast on Ethanim (Tishri) 10, the Day of Atonement. However, some hold that, while the Jubilee year started with the Day of Atonement, the Sabbath year started with Tishri&nbsp;1. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v2'><b><a href='#c15v2'>15:2 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 601</b> : According to Deuteronomy 15:1-3, it appears that during the Sabbath year (every seventh year) a creditor could not press a fellow Israelite for payment of a debt. Unlike the Sabbath-keeping Israelite who realized virtually no return from his land, the foreigner continued to have an income from his nonagricultural work. Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. <br><br><b>it-2 833</b> : There was also to be a rest, or a release, on debts incurred. It was &ldquo;a release to Jehovah,&rdquo; in honor of him. Though others view it differently, some commentators hold that the debts were not actually canceled, but, rather, that a creditor was not to press a fellow Hebrew for payment of a debt, for there would be no income for the farmer during that year; though the lender could press a foreigner for payment. (De 15:1-3) Some rabbis hold the view that debts for loans of charity to help a poor brother were canceled, but that debts incurred in business dealings were in a different category. It is said by them that, in the first century of the Common Era, Hillel instituted a procedure whereby the lender could go before the court and secure his debt against forfeiture by making a certain declaration.&mdash;The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, edited by J.&nbsp;Hertz, London, 1972, pp.&nbsp;811, 812. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v4'><b><a href='#c15v4'>15:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122</b> : It was on the tenth day of the seventh month (in the month of Tishri), on the Day of Atonement, that the horn (shoh&middot;phar&prime;, or sho&middot;phar&prime;, a curved, animal horn) was sounded, proclaiming liberty throughout the land. This meant freedom for the Hebrew slaves, many of whom had sold themselves because of debt. Such release normally would not come until the seventh year of servitude (Ex 21:2), but the Jubilee provided liberty even for those who had not yet served for six years. All hereditary land possessions that had been sold (usually because of financial reverses) were returned, and each man returned to his family and his ancestral possession. No family was to sink into the depths of perpetual poverty. Every family was to have its honor and respect. Even a person who squandered his substance could not forever lose his inheritance for his posterity. After all, the land was really Jehovah&rsquo;s, and the Israelites themselves were alien residents and settlers from Jehovah&rsquo;s standpoint. (Le 25:23,&nbsp;24) If the nation kept God&rsquo;s laws, then, as he said, &ldquo;No one should come to be poor among you.&rdquo;&mdash;Le 25:8-10,&nbsp;13;&nbsp;De 15:4,&nbsp;5. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v6'><b><a href='#c15v6'>15:6 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 122-123</b> : The wonderful provision of the Jubilee year can better be appreciated when one considers not only the beneficial results to the individual Israelites but especially the effect on the nation as a whole. When the Jubilee arrangement was properly observed, the nation was restored in the Jubilee year to the full and proper theocratic state that God purposed and established at the beginning. Government was on a sound basis. The national economy would always be stable, and the nation would have no crushing debt. (De 15:6) The Jubilee brought about a stable standard of land values and also prevented a great internal debt and its resultant false prosperity that brings inflation, deflation, and business depression. The Jubilee law, when obeyed, preserved the nation from gravitating to the sad state that we observe today in many lands, where there are virtually only two classes, the extremely rich and the extremely poor. The benefits to the individual strengthened the nation, for none would be underprivileged and crushed into unproductiveness by a bad economic situation, but all could contribute their talents and abilities to the national welfare. With Jehovah providing blessings of the yield of the ground and with the education that was provided, Israel, while obedient, would enjoy the perfect government and prosperity that only the true theocracy could provide.&mdash;Isa 33:22. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v7'><b><a href='#c15v7'>15:7 </a></b> <br><b>w10 9/15 8</b> : 5 Consider how such trusting obedience might have been manifested by keeping the law stated at Deuteronomy 15:7,&nbsp;8. (Read.) Begrudging compliance with that law might have resulted in some initial relief to the poor, but would it have engendered good relationships and an atmosphere of warmth among God&rsquo;s people? More important, would it have reflected faith in Jehovah&rsquo;s ability to provide for his servants and appreciation for the opportunity to mirror his generosity? Hardly! God took note of the heart condition of the truly generous person and promised to bless him in his every deed and every undertaking. (Deut. 15:10) Faith in that promise would give rise to action and would result in many rich blessings.&mdash;Prov. 28:20. <br></div><br><br>
