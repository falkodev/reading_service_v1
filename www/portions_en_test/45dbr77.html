<div id='recherchec18v15'><b><a href='#c18v15'>18:15 </a></b> <br><b>w09 4/15 24-28</b> : 6 Shortly after Pentecost 33&nbsp;C.E., the apostle Peter quoted a prophecy by Moses that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Peter was standing before a crowd of worshippers in the temple. The people were &ldquo;surprised out of their wits&rdquo; when Peter and John healed a beggar who was lame from birth, and they all ran to investigate. Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah&rsquo;s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ. Then, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures, he said: &ldquo;In fact, Moses said, &lsquo;Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 3:11,&nbsp;22, 23; read Deuteronomy 18:15,&nbsp;18,&nbsp;19. 7 Those words of Moses were likely familiar to Peter&rsquo;s audience. As Jews, they had a high regard for Moses. (Deut. 34:10) With keen anticipation, they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses. That prophet would prove to be not just a messiah, an anointed one of God like Moses, but the Messiah, &ldquo;the Christ of God, the Chosen One&rdquo; of Jehovah.&mdash;Luke 23:35;&nbsp;Heb. 11:26. 8 In some respects, the earthly life of Jesus resembled the life of Moses. For instance, as babes, both Moses and Jesus escaped death at the hands of a tyrannical ruler. (Ex. 1:22&ndash;2:10;&nbsp;Matt. 2:7-14) In addition, both were &lsquo;called out of Egypt.&rsquo; The prophet Hosea stated: &ldquo;When Israel was a boy, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&rdquo; (Hos. 11:1) Hosea&rsquo;s words pointed back to the time when the nation of Israel, under its divinely appointed leader, Moses, was led out of Egypt. (Ex. 4:22, 23;&nbsp;12:29-37) However, Hosea&rsquo;s words referred not only to a past event but also to a future one. His words were a prophecy that was fulfilled when Joseph and Mary returned from Egypt with Jesus after the death of King Herod.&mdash;Matt. 2:15,&nbsp;19-23. 9 Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah&rsquo;s backing. Indeed, Moses was the first human on record to perform miracles. (Ex. 4:1-9) For example, Moses performed miracles involving water when at his command the waters of the Nile and its reedy pools became blood, the Red Sea was parted, and water came gushing out of rock in the desert. (Ex. 7:19-21;&nbsp;14:21;&nbsp;17:5-7) Jesus too performed miracles involving water. His very first miracle was that of turning water into wine at a wedding feast. (John 2:1-11) Later, he calmed the turbulent Sea of Galilee. And on one occasion, he even walked on water! (Matt. 8:23-27;&nbsp;14:23-25) Some other similarities between Moses and the Greater Moses, Jesus, can be seen in the box on page&nbsp;26. 10 Most people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but that is only part of a prophet&rsquo;s responsibility. A true prophet is an inspired spokesman for Jehovah, one who proclaims &ldquo;the magnificent things of God.&rdquo; (Acts 2:11,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;17) Among other things, his prophesying could include announcing future events, revealing aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose, or proclaiming God&rsquo;s judgments. Moses was such a prophet. He foretold each of the Ten Plagues that befell Egypt. He introduced the Law covenant at Sinai. And he instructed the nation in God&rsquo;s will. Yet, a prophet greater than Moses was to come eventually. 11 Later, in the first century, Zechariah acted as a prophet in revealing God&rsquo;s purpose regarding his son, John. (Luke 1:76) That son became John the Baptizer, who announced the coming of the long-awaited prophet greater than Moses&mdash;Jesus Christ. (John 1:23-36) As a prophet, Jesus foretold many things. For example, he spoke about his own death, foretelling how he would die, where he would die, and at whose hands he would die. (Matt. 20:17-19) To the surprise of his listeners, Jesus also foretold the destruction of Jerusalem with its temple. (Mark 13:1,&nbsp;2) His prophecies reach right down to our own time.&mdash;Matt. 24:3-41. 12 In addition to being a prophet, Jesus was a preacher and a teacher. He preached the good news of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and no one spoke with greater boldness than he did. (Luke 4:16-21,&nbsp;43) As a teacher, he had no equal. &ldquo;Never has another man spoken like this,&rdquo; said some who heard him. (John 7:46) Jesus was zealous in his efforts to spread the good news, and he inspired his followers with that same zeal for the Kingdom. Thus, he laid the foundation for a global preaching and teaching campaign that is still continuing. (Matt. 28:18-20;&nbsp;Acts 5:42) Last year, some seven million of Christ&rsquo;s followers spent about 1,500,000,000 hours in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching interested ones Bible truths. Do you have a meaningful share in that work? 13 There is no question that Jehovah fulfilled the prophecy to raise up a prophet like Moses. How does that knowledge affect you? Does it give you more confidence in the fulfillment of inspired prophecies that have to do with our immediate future? Yes, meditating on the example of the Greater Moses moves us to &ldquo;stay awake and keep our senses&rdquo; as to what God will soon do.&mdash;1&nbsp;Thess. 5:2,&nbsp;6. 14 Like Moses, Jesus was a mediator. A mediator acts as a bridge between two parties. Moses mediated the Law covenant between Jehovah and the Israelites. If the sons of Jacob obeyed the laws of God, they would remain God&rsquo;s special property, his congregation. (Ex. 19:3-8) That covenant stayed in force from 1513&nbsp;B.C.E. until the first century C.E. 15 In 33&nbsp;C.E., Jehovah initiated a better covenant with a new Israel, &ldquo;the Israel of God,&rdquo; which became a worldwide congregation made up of anointed Christians. (Gal. 6:16) While the covenant mediated by Moses included laws written by God on stone, the covenant mediated by Jesus is superior. Its laws are inscribed by God on human hearts. (Read 1&nbsp;Timothy 2:5;&nbsp;Hebrews 8:10.) Thus, &ldquo;the Israel of God&rdquo; is now God&rsquo;s special property, &lsquo;a nation producing the fruits&rsquo; of the Messianic Kingdom. (Matt. 21:43) Members of that spiritual nation are the participants in that new covenant. Still, they are not the only ones to benefit from it. Untold multitudes, even many who at present are asleep in death, will receive everlasting blessings because of that superlative covenant. 16 On their last night before the Exodus, some of the offspring of Israel were in grave danger. Soon, God&rsquo;s angel would pass through the land of Egypt, killing all the firstborn. Jehovah told Moses that the firstborn of Israel would be saved if the Israelites took the blood of the Passover lamb and sprinkled it on the lintels and doorposts of their doorways. (Ex. 12:1-13,&nbsp;21-23) So it proved to be. Later, the whole nation was in serious danger. They were trapped between the Red Sea and the pursuing Egyptian war chariots. Jehovah again provided deliverance through Moses, who miraculously parted the waters of that sea.&mdash;Ex. 14:13,&nbsp;21. 17 Great as those acts of deliverance were, the deliverance Jehovah performed through Jesus is much greater. Jesus is the means by which obedient ones are delivered from slavery to sin. (Rom. 5:12,&nbsp;18) And that deliverance is &ldquo;an everlasting deliverance.&rdquo; (Heb. 9:11,&nbsp;12) The name Jesus means &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; Jesus, as our Deliverer, or Savior, not only rescues us from our past sins but also opens the way for us to enjoy a better future. By delivering them from slavery to sin, Jesus saves his followers from the wrath of God and brings them into a loving relationship with Jehovah.&mdash;Matt. 1:21. 18 The deliverance from sin that Jesus provides will in due time include freedom from its grim effects&mdash;sickness and even death. To visualize what that will mean, consider what happened when Jesus went to the home of a certain man named Jairus, whose 12-year-old daughter had died. Jesus reassured Jairus: &ldquo;Have no fear, only put forth faith, and she will be saved.&rdquo; (Luke 8:41, 42,&nbsp;49,&nbsp;50) True to his words, the girl rose from the dead! Can you imagine the joy of her parents? Then you have an idea of the surpassing joy that will be ours when &ldquo;all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus&rsquo;] voice and come out&rdquo; in the resurrection. (John 5:28,&nbsp;29) Truly, Jesus is a Savior, our Deliverer!&mdash;Read Acts 5:31;&nbsp;Titus 1:4;&nbsp;Rev. 7:10. 19 Knowing that we can be instrumental in helping people to benefit from Jesus&rsquo; saving acts impels us to share in the preaching and teaching work. (Isa. 61:1-3) Further, meditating on Jesus&rsquo; role as the Greater Moses deepens our confidence that he will deliver his followers when he comes to execute judgment upon the wicked.&mdash;Matt. 25:31-34,&nbsp;41,&nbsp;46;&nbsp;Rev. 7:9,&nbsp;14. 20 Yes, Jesus is the Greater Moses. He did many marvelous things that Moses could never have done. Jesus&rsquo; words as a prophet and his actions as a mediator affect the entire human family. As a Deliverer, Jesus brings not temporary but eternal salvation for redeemable mankind. <br><br><b>g04 4/8 12-13</b> : We live in distressing times. Mankind certainly needs a leader like Moses&mdash;someone who has not only power and authority but also integrity, courage, compassion, and a heartfelt love of justice. When Moses died, the Israelites must have wondered, &lsquo;Will the world see the likes of him again?&rsquo; Moses himself answered that question. Moses&rsquo; writings explain how sickness and death came about in the first place and why God permitted wickedness to continue. (Genesis 3:1-19;&nbsp;Job, chapters&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2) At Genesis 3:15, the very first divine prophecy is recorded&mdash;a promise that evil will eventually be crushed! How? The prophecy indicated that an individual would be born through whom salvation would come. This promise gave birth to the hope that a Messiah would arise and deliver mankind. But who would the Messiah be? Moses helps us to identify him conclusively. Toward the end of his life, Moses uttered these portentous words: &ldquo;A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you&mdash;to him you people should listen.&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 18:15) The apostle Peter later applied those words directly to Jesus.&mdash;Acts 3:20-26. Most Jewish commentators vigorously deny any comparison of Moses with Jesus. They argue that the words of this text apply to any true prophet who came after Moses. However, according to Tanakh&mdash;The Holy Scriptures, by the Jewish Publication Society, Deuteronomy 34:10 says: &ldquo;Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses&mdash;whom the LORD singled out, face to face.&rdquo; Yes, many faithful prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, came after Moses. But none had the unique relationship with God that Moses enjoyed&mdash;speaking with him &ldquo;face to face.&rdquo; Moses&rsquo; promise of a prophet &lsquo;like him&rsquo; must therefore apply to one individual&mdash;the Messiah! It is noteworthy that before the advent of Christianity&mdash;and religious persecution from false Christians&mdash;Jewish scholars viewed things similarly. Echoes of this can be seen in Jewish writings, such as the Midrash Rabbah, which describes Moses as the forerunner of the &ldquo;latter Redeemer,&rdquo; or Messiah. That Jesus was like Moses in many ways cannot be denied. (See the box &ldquo;Jesus&mdash;A Prophet Like Moses.&rdquo;) Jesus has power and authority. (Matthew 28:19) Jesus is &ldquo;mild-tempered and lowly in heart.&rdquo; (Matthew 11:29) Jesus hates lawlessness and injustice. (Hebrews 1:9) He can therefore give us the leadership we sorely need! It is he who will soon crush wickedness and bring the earth to the Paradise conditions that the Bible describes. <br></div><br>

As you can imagine, some people might be drawn by cures and miraculously provided food. (Matthew 4:24, 25;&nbsp;8:16;&nbsp;9:32, 33;&nbsp;14:35, 36;&nbsp;John 6:26) Beyond being of physical help, however, those works actually moved observers to recognize that Jesus was the Son of God and &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; that Moses had foretold.&mdash;John 6:14;&nbsp;Deuteronomy 18:15. 13 Why was it significant that Jesus was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo;? Well, what was the key role foretold for that one? Was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; to be famous for performing miraculous healings or compassionately producing food for the hungry? Deuteronomy 18:18 predicted: &ldquo;A prophet I shall raise up for them from the midst of their brothers, like you [Moses]; and I shall indeed put my words in his mouth, and he will certainly speak to them all that I shall command him.&rdquo; <br><br><b>it-2 386</b> : A prophet who would perform many signs.

(Joh 6:14) The way in which the apostle Peter used Moses&rsquo; words, at Acts 3:22, 23, indicates he knew they would be accepted as Messianic in nature even by religious opposers, and this gives evidence of widespread understanding of Deuteronomy 18:18. The Samaritan woman by the well also thought the Messiah would be a prophet.

In many ways there was pictorial correspondency between these two great prophets, Moses and Jesus Christ. In infancy both escaped the wholesale slaughter ordered by the respective rulers of their time. (Ex 1:22;&nbsp;2:1-10;&nbsp;Mt 2:13-18) Moses was called out of Egypt with Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;firstborn,&rdquo; the nation of Israel, Moses being the nation&rsquo;s leader. Jesus was called out of Egypt as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. (Ex 4:22, 23;&nbsp;Ho 11:1;&nbsp;Mt 2:15,&nbsp;19-21) Both fasted for 40 days in wilderness places. (Ex 34:28;&nbsp;Mt 4:1,&nbsp;2) Both came in the name of Jehovah, Jesus&rsquo; name itself meaning &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; (Ex 3:13-16;&nbsp;Mt 1:21;&nbsp;Joh 5:43) Jesus, like Moses, &lsquo;declared the name of Jehovah.&rsquo; (De 32:3;&nbsp;Joh 17:6,&nbsp;26) Both were exceptional in meekness and humility. (Nu 12:3;&nbsp;Mt 11:28-30) Both had the most convincing credentials to show that they were sent by God&mdash;astounding miracles of many sorts, Jesus Christ going farther than Moses by raising dead persons to life.&mdash;Ex 14:21-31;&nbsp;Ps 78:12-54;&nbsp;Mt 11:5;&nbsp;Mr 5:38-43;&nbsp;Lu 7:11-15,&nbsp;18-23. Moses was mediator of the Law covenant between God and the nation of Israel. Jesus was Mediator of the new covenant between God and the &ldquo;holy nation,&rdquo; the spiritual &ldquo;Israel of God.&rdquo; (1Pe 2:9;&nbsp;Ga 6:16;&nbsp;Ex 19:3-9;&nbsp;Lu 22:20;&nbsp;Heb 8:6;&nbsp;9:15) Both served as judges, lawgivers, and leaders. (Ex 18:13;&nbsp;32:34;&nbsp;Da 9:25;&nbsp;Mal 4:4;&nbsp;Mt 23:10;&nbsp;Joh 5:22, 23;&nbsp;13:34;&nbsp;15:10) Moses was entrusted with and proved faithful to his stewardship in the &lsquo;house of God,&rsquo; that is, the nation, or congregation, of Israel. Jesus showed faithfulness over God&rsquo;s house that he as God&rsquo;s Son constructed, namely, the nation, or congregation, of spiritual Israel. (Nu 12:7;&nbsp;Heb 3:2-6) And even in death there was a parallel: God disposed of the bodies of both Moses and Jesus.&mdash;De 34:5,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;Ac 2:31;&nbsp;Jude&nbsp;9. Toward the end of Moses&rsquo; 40-year sojourn in the wilderness, while he was shepherding his father-in-law&rsquo;s flock, God&rsquo;s angel made a miraculous manifestation to him in the flame of a thornbush at the foot of Mount Horeb. Jehovah there commissioned him to deliver His people from Egypt. (Ex 3:1-15) Thus God appointed Moses as His prophet and representative, and Moses could now correctly be called an anointed one, or &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; In order to come into that privileged position, Moses had had to give up &ldquo;the treasures of Egypt&rdquo; and let himself &ldquo;be ill-treated with the people of God&rdquo; and thus suffer reproach. But to Moses such &ldquo;reproach of the Christ&rdquo; was riches greater than all of Egypt&rsquo;s wealth.&mdash;Heb 11:24-26. A parallel to this is found in Jesus Christ. According to the angel&rsquo;s announcement at his birth in Bethlehem, he was to become &ldquo;a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; He became Christ, or Anointed One, after the prophet John baptized him in the Jordan River. (Lu 2:10, 11;&nbsp;3:21-23;&nbsp;4:16-21) Thereafter he acknowledged that he was &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; or Messiah. (Mt 16:16, 17;&nbsp;Mr 14:61, 62;&nbsp;Joh 4:25,&nbsp;26) Jesus Christ also kept his eye on the prize and despised the shame that men heaped upon him, as Moses had done. (Php 2:8,&nbsp;9;&nbsp;Heb 12:2) It is into this Greater Moses that the Christian congregation is baptized&mdash;into Jesus Christ, the foretold Prophet, Liberator, and Leader.&mdash;1Co 10:1,&nbsp;2. <br><br><b>697</b> : PROPHET<br></div><br><br>
