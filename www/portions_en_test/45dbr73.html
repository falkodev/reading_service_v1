<a id='c15v8' href='#recherchec15v8'>8</a>&nbsp;For you should generously open your hand to him and by all means lend whatever he needs or is lacking. <input type='hidden' value='15:8'><a id='c15v9' href='#recherchec15v9'>9</a>&nbsp;Be careful not to harbor this evil idea in your heart, &lsquo;The seventh year, the year of the release, has approached,&rsquo; and hold back your generosity toward your poor brother and give him nothing. If he calls out to Jehovah against you, it will be a sin on your part. <input type='hidden' value='15:9'>10&nbsp;You should generously give to him, and you should not give to him grudgingly, for this is why Jehovah your God will bless your every deed and undertaking. <input type='hidden' value='15:10'><a id='c15v11' href='#recherchec15v11'>11</a>&nbsp;For there will always be poor people in the land. That is why I am commanding you, &lsquo;You should generously open up your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land.&rsquo;

<a id='c15v12' href='#recherchec15v12'>12</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;If one of your brothers, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you and has served you for six years, then in the seventh year you should set him free. <input type='hidden' value='15:12'>13&nbsp;And if you should set him free, do not send him away empty-handed. <input type='hidden' value='15:13'>14&nbsp;You should supply him generously with something from your flock, your threshing floor, and your press for oil and wine. Just as Jehovah your God has blessed you, you should give to him. <input type='hidden' value='15:14'>15&nbsp;Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God redeemed you. That is why I am commanding you to do this today.

16&nbsp;&ldquo;But if he says to you, &lsquo;I will not go out from your company!&rsquo; because he loves you and your household, since he has been happy while with you, <input type='hidden' value='15:16'>17&nbsp;you should then take an awl and put it through his ear into the door, and he will become your slave for life. You should do the same with your slave girl. <input type='hidden' value='15:17'>18&nbsp;Do not consider it a hardship when you set him free and he leaves you, because his service to you for six years was worth twice as much as that of a hired worker, and Jehovah your God has blessed you in everything that was done.

19&nbsp;&ldquo;You should sanctify every firstborn male of your herd and your flock to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work with the firstborn of your herd nor shear the firstborn of your flock. <input type='hidden' value='15:19'>20&nbsp;You and your household should eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place that Jehovah will choose. <input type='hidden' value='15:20'>21&nbsp;But if it has a defect&mdash;lameness, blindness, or any other serious defect&mdash;you must not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God. <input type='hidden' value='15:21'>22&nbsp;You should eat it inside your cities, the unclean and clean person together, as though it were a gazelle or a deer. <input type='hidden' value='15:22'><a id='c15v23' href='#recherchec15v23'>23</a>&nbsp;But you must not eat its blood; you should pour it out on the ground like water.

<div id='recherchec15v8'><b><a href='#c15v8'>15:8 </a></b> <br><b>w10 9/15 8</b> : 5 Consider how such trusting obedience might have been manifested by keeping the law stated at Deuteronomy 15:7,&nbsp;8. (Read.) Begrudging compliance with that law might have resulted in some initial relief to the poor, but would it have engendered good relationships and an atmosphere of warmth among God&rsquo;s people? More important, would it have reflected faith in Jehovah&rsquo;s ability to provide for his servants and appreciation for the opportunity to mirror his generosity? Hardly! God took note of the heart condition of the truly generous person and promised to bless him in his every deed and every undertaking. (Deut. 15:10) Faith in that promise would give rise to action and would result in many rich blessings.&mdash;Prov. 28:20. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v9'><b><a href='#c15v9'>15:9 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 601</b> : According to Deuteronomy 15:1-3, it appears that during the Sabbath year (every seventh year) a creditor could not press a fellow Israelite for payment of a debt. Unlike the Sabbath-keeping Israelite who realized virtually no return from his land, the foreigner continued to have an income from his nonagricultural work. Reasonably, therefore, he could be pressed for payment of a debt during the Sabbath year. At the approach of the Sabbath year, some Israelites, knowing that they would not be able to press matters, may have refrained from lending to their needy brothers. But the Law condemned such selfishness.&mdash;De 15:9. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v11'><b><a href='#c15v11'>15:11 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 939</b> : Actually, there should have been no poor persons among the Israelites, for Jehovah promised to bless his people. But the absence of poverty was contingent on obedience to the Law. Therefore, because of human imperfection and disobedience to God&rsquo;s law, the Israelites would always have the poor in their midst. (De 15:4, 5,&nbsp;11) <br><br><b>it-2 652</b> : Faithful adherence to God&rsquo;s law would largely have prevented poverty among the Israelites. (De 15:4,&nbsp;5) However, if disobedient, they would not have Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, and this would lead to impoverishment due to such calamities as invasions by enemy armies and severe drought. (De 28:22-25; compare Jg 6:1-6;&nbsp;1Ki 17:1;&nbsp;18:17, 18;&nbsp;Jas 5:17,&nbsp;18.) Individuals, because of being lazy (Pr 6:10, 11;&nbsp;10:4;&nbsp;19:15;&nbsp;20:13;&nbsp;24:30-34), drunkards, gluttons (Pr 23:21), or pleasure-seekers (Pr 21:17), could bring poverty on themselves and their families. Then, too, unforeseen circumstances might arise that could plunge persons into poverty. Death could leave behind orphans and widows. Accidents and sickness could temporarily or permanently hinder a person from performing necessary work. For these reasons Jehovah could say to Israel: &ldquo;Someone poor will never cease to be in the midst of the land.&rdquo;&mdash;De 15:11. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v12'><b><a href='#c15v12'>15:12 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : This year of release, or rest from being pressed for payment of debts, did not apply to the release of slaves, many of whom would be in slavery because of indebtedness. Rather, the Hebrew slave was released in the seventh year of his servitude or on the Jubilee, whichever came first.&mdash;De 15:12;&nbsp;Le 25:10,&nbsp;54. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v23'><b><a href='#c15v23'>15:23 </a></b> <br><b>w00 10/15 30-31</b> : Occasionally, a doctor will urge a patient to deposit his own blood weeks before surgery (preoperative autologous blood donation, or PAD) so that if the need arises, he could transfuse the patient with his own stored blood. However, such collecting, storing, and transfusing of blood directly contradicts what is said in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Blood is not to be stored; it is to be poured out&mdash;returned to God, as it were. Granted, the Mosaic Law is not in force now. Nevertheless, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses respect the principles God included in it, and they are determined to &lsquo;abstain from blood.&rsquo; Hence, we do not donate blood, nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be &lsquo;poured out.&rsquo; That practice conflicts with God&rsquo;s law. <br></div><br><br>
