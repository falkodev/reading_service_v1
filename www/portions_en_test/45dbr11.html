Self-mutilation shows disrespect for the human body, may be connected with false religion, and must be avoided. (1&nbsp;Kings 18:25-28) Our hope in the resurrection makes such an extreme expression of mourning for the dead inappropriate. <br><br><b>it-1 563</b> : God&rsquo;s Law specifically forbade the making of cuttings upon the flesh for the dead. (Le 19:28;&nbsp;21:5;&nbsp;De 14:1) The reason for this was that Israel was a holy people to Jehovah, a special property. (De 14:2) As such, Israel was to remain free from all idolatrous practices. Then, too, such extreme displays of mourning accompanied by self-inflicted lacerations upon the flesh were most inappropriate for a people who were fully aware of the actual condition of the dead as well as the resurrection hope. (Da 12:13;&nbsp;Heb 11:19) Also, the prohibition against self-mutilation would have impressed upon the Israelites proper respect for God&rsquo;s creation, the human body. <br><br><b>it-2 997</b> : Thus the entire nation of Israel was viewed by God as his &ldquo;son&rdquo; because of being his chosen people, a &ldquo;special property, out of all the peoples.&rdquo; (De 14:1,&nbsp;2) <br></div><br>

There is uncertainty as to which animal is meant by the Hebrew word di&middot;shon&prime;. The addax antelope (Addax nasomaculatus), still surviving in the desert regions of North Africa, is often suggested as corresponding to the di&middot;shon&prime; of the Hebrew Scriptures. This antelope measures about 1&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;in.) high at the shoulder. Its spreading, cloven hooves equip it admirably for travel in the loose sands of the desert, where it can survive without water for extremely long periods. The widespread horns of this animal are twisted like a screw, making from one and a half to nearly three turns, and measuring about 1&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;in.) along the curve. With the exception of the belly, tail, hindquarters, and facial markings, which always remain white, the color of the addax antelope becomes darker in winter, changing from a sandy color to brownish. Another possibility is the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), also a desert antelope. <br><br><b>426</b> : A small goatlike antelope characterized by its hook-tipped horns and noted for its agility and surefootedness at dizzying heights. The grown male may measure 80&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in.) at the shoulder and may weigh over 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lb). The summer coat of the chamois is a tawny color that gets darker with the advent of the winter season. The chamois is listed among the animals suitable for food, according to the requirements of the Law.&mdash;De 14:5. There is uncertainty as to the animal meant by the Hebrew word ze&prime;mer, which is variously rendered &ldquo;chamois&rdquo; (KJ, AS, ER, NW, Yg), &ldquo;mountain goat&rdquo; (La), &ldquo;mountain sheep&rdquo; (AT, JB, Mo, Ro), &ldquo;antelope&rdquo; (Le), and simply transliterated as &ldquo;zemer&rdquo; (Kx). The Hebrew root from which the word ze&prime;mer is derived is thought to be related to the Arabic zamara (bounce; flee), suggesting a bouncing, leaping animal, hence similar to a gazelle. Some zoologists maintain that the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) was never found in Palestine. However, it may be noted that local varieties of this animal are to be found in the Carpathian and Caucasus mountains, thus allowing for the possibility that at one time a variety of the chamois may have existed in the ranges of Lebanon. <br><br><b>966</b> : At Deuteronomy 14:4, 5, where the reference is to animals acceptable for food, the Hebrew word &#700;aq&middot;qoh&prime; has been translated &ldquo;wild goat.&rdquo; (AS, KJ, NW, RS) Many scholars believe that &#700;aq&middot;qoh&prime; may designate the same animal as ye&#701;e&middot;lim&prime;, that is, the Nubian ibex. <br><br><b>it-2 917</b> : Wild Sheep.

Wild sheep are distinguished from domestic sheep by their outer coat, which is of coarse hair rather than wool. The variety of wild sheep that is now geographically closest to Palestine is the Armenian wild sheep (Ovis gmelini), found in the mountain ridges of Asia Minor and eastern Iran.

<div id='recherchec14v7'><b><a href='#c14v7'>14:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 555-556</b> : The Scriptural reference to the hare as a cud chewer has frequently been doubted by some critics of the Bible. (Le 11:4,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;De 14:7) It should not be overlooked, however, that the modern, scientific classification of what constitutes chewing of the cud provides no basis for judging what the Bible says, as such classification did not exist in the time of Moses. Even in the 18th&nbsp;century, English poet William Cowper, who had at length observed his domestic hares, commented that they &ldquo;chewed the cud all day till evening.&rdquo; Linnaeus, famed naturalist of the same century, believed that rabbits chewed the cud. But it remained for others to supply more scientific data. Frenchman Morot discovered in 1882 that rabbits reingest up to 90&nbsp;percent of their daily intake. Concerning the hare, Ivan T.&nbsp;Sanderson in a recent publication remarks: &ldquo;One of the most extraordinary [habits], to our way of thinking, is their method of digestion. This is not unique to Leporids [hares, rabbits] and is now known to occur in many Rodents. When fresh green food, as opposed to desiccated [dried] winter forage, is available, the animals gobble it up voraciously and then excrete it around their home lairs in a semi-digested form. After some time this is then re-eaten, and the process may be repeated more than once. In the Common Rabbit, it appears that only the fully grown adults indulge this practice.&rdquo;&mdash;Living Mammals of the World, 1955, p.&nbsp;114. Certain British scientists made close observations of the rabbits&rsquo; habits under careful controls, and the results they obtained were published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1940, Vol.&nbsp;110, pp.&nbsp;159-163. Briefly this is the way the hare reingests its food: If a rabbit eats a breakfast of fresh food, it passes through the stomach into the small intestine, leaving behind in the cardiac end of the stomach some 40 or 50 grams of pellets that were already present when the fresh food was eaten. From the small intestine the morning meal enters the caecum or blind end of the large intestine and there remains for a period of time. During the day the pellets descend, and in the intestines the bacterial protein in them is digested. When they reach the large intestine they bypass the material in the caecum and go on into the colon where the excess moisture is absorbed to produce the familiar dry beans or droppings that are cast away. This phase of the cycle completed, the material stored in the dead end of the caecum next enters the colon, but instead of having all the moisture absorbed it reaches the anus in a rather soft condition. It is in pellet form with each coated with a tough layer of mucus to prevent them from sticking together. Now when these pellets reach the anus, instead of being cast away, the rabbit doubles up and takes them into the mouth and stores them away in the cardiac end of the stomach until another meal has been eaten. In this way the special rhythmic cycle is completed and most of the food has passed a second time through the digestive tract. Dr.&nbsp;Waldo L.&nbsp;Schmitt, Head Curator, Department of Zoology of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,&nbsp;D.C., in commenting on these findings, wrote: &ldquo;There seems to be no reason to doubt the authenticity of the reports of various workers that rabbits customarily store semi-digested food in the caecum and that this is later reingested and passes a second time through the digestive tract.&rdquo; He also observed that here is an explanation for &ldquo;the phenomenally large caecum of rabbits as compared with most other mammals.&rdquo;&mdash;Awake!, April&nbsp;22, 1951, pp.&nbsp;27,&nbsp;28. <br><br><b>1035</b> : The hare was prohibited as food under the Law given through Moses and is referred to as a chewer of the cud. (Le 11:4,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;De 14:7) Hares and rabbits, of course, do not have a multichambered or multiparted stomach and do not regurgitate their food for rechewing, which characteristics are associated with the scientific classification of ruminants or cud chewers. Nevertheless, although the Hebrew term here used for chewing literally means &ldquo;bringing up,&rdquo; the modern scientific classification was not the basis for what the Israelites in Moses&rsquo; day understood &lsquo;cud chewing&rsquo; to be. Hence, there is no foundation for judging the accuracy of the Bible statement by the restricted, relatively recent conception of what constitutes a cud-chewing animal, as done by many critics. In the past, commentators with faith in the inspiration of the Bible record saw no error in the statement of the Law. Observed The Imperial Bible-Dictionary: &ldquo;It is obvious that the hare does in repose chew over and over the food which it has some time taken; and this action has always been popularly considered a chewing of the cud. Even our poet Cowper, a careful noticer of natural phenomena, who has recorded his observations on the three hares which he had domesticated, affirms that they &lsquo;chewed the cud all day till evening.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Edited by P.&nbsp;Fairbairn, London, 1874, Vol.&nbsp;I, p.&nbsp;700. Scientific observation of hares and rabbits in more recent years, however, indicates that even more than seeming cud chewing is involved. Writes Fran&ccedil;ois Bourli&egrave;re (The Natural History of Mammals, 1964, p.&nbsp;41): &ldquo;The habit of &lsquo;refection,&rsquo; or passing the food twice through the intestine instead of only once, seems to be a common phenomenon in the rabbits and hares. Domestic rabbits usually eat and swallow without chewing their night droppings, which form in the morning as much as half the total contents of the stomach. In the wild rabbit refection takes place twice daily, and the same habit is reported for the European hare. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is believed that this habit provides the animals with large amounts of B vitamins produced by bacteria in the food within the large intestine.&rdquo; On the same point, the work Mammals of the World (by E.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Walker, 1964, Vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;647) notes: &ldquo;This may be similar to &lsquo;chewing the cud&rsquo; in ruminant mammals.&rdquo;&mdash;See CUD. <br><br><b>it-2 816</b> : Some have taken issue with its classification in Scripture as a creature that chews the cud but does not split the hoof. (Le 11:5;&nbsp;De 14:7) However, zoologist Hubert Hendrichs, in observing rock badgers at the Hellabrunn Zoological Gardens near Munich, Germany, noticed that these creatures made peculiar chewing and swallowing movements. He found that rock badgers actually do chew the cud from 25 to 50 minutes a day, usually during the night. The German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung of March&nbsp;12, 1966, commented on the discovery: &ldquo;Although this fact was previously unknown to accepted zoology, it is not new. In the eleventh chapter of Leviticus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can find it.&rdquo; The claim has also been made that the hoofed toes of the rock badger are doubly cloven. However, it could hardly be said that the rock badger&rsquo;s front feet, each having four toes terminating in hooflike endings, and the hind feet, each equipped with three toes and a corresponding number of miniature hoofs or nails, resemble the foot member of a &lsquo;splitter of the hoof&rsquo; such as a cow. <br></div><br>

However, the plural form (dai&middot;yohth&prime;) appears at Isaiah 34:15 as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation. The identification of this bird is uncertain.

Although the King James Version renders the Hebrew name of this bird as &ldquo;cuckow&rdquo; (cuckoo), this translation has generally been abandoned in favor of sea gull (sometimes called sea mew). (See CUCKOO.) Some lexicographers understand the name to be derived from a root meaning &ldquo;be thin, slender, or lean,&rdquo; which might describe the gull from the standpoint of its trim appearance and the relative narrowness of the body as compared with the long, pointed wings. Others believe the Hebrew name sha&prime;chaph is in imitation of the shrill cry made by this generally noisy bird. The older versions (LXX, Vg) also understood it to refer to the seagoing gull. The Hebrew term sha&prime;chaph may be understood to be a generic term for a web-footed seabird resembling a gull. This group includes the true gulls, terns, skimmers, and skuas. Gulls, members of the family Laridae, are generally powerful fliers, and in addition to swimming well, they rest and even sleep on the water. The gull alternately flaps its wings, soars, wheels, and glides downward to pick up food in the form of fish, insects, and practically any kind of offal and garbage (thus serving as a valuable scavenger in ports and harbors). Herring gulls carry mussels or other mollusks up into the air and then drop them on rocks to break them open and make possible the eating of their contents.

This bird appears only in the list of unclean birds under the Mosaic Law, a list that prohibits the eating of birds most of which basically are birds of prey and carrion eaters. (Le 11:17;&nbsp;De 14:17) The translators of the Greek Septuagint understood the bird to be the ka&middot;tar&middot;ra&prime;ktes, the Greek name for cormorant, while the Latin Vulgate uses mergulus (the &ldquo;diver&rdquo;) to indicate the bird. The cormorant (Phalacrocorax) is quite common in Palestine, particularly along the Mediterranean Coast and also in certain inland waters such as the Sea of Galilee. The cormorant is related to birds of the pelican family. Usually long bodied and dark colored, the cormorant is swift and agile in the water, swimming under water mainly by use of its webbed feet. Its sharp, hooked beak makes it a good fisher, and from ancient times cormorants have been trained by fishermen in the Orient and parts of India to catch fish for their owners, a band being placed fairly loosely around the bird&rsquo;s throat to prevent it from swallowing anything but very small fish. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v18'><b><a href='#c14v18'>14:18 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 1137</b> : About the size of a slender pigeon, the hoopoe (Upupa epops) is a somewhat cinnamon-colored bird, distinctively marked with alternate broad bars of white and black along its wings and back. Its most conspicuous feature is a crest of plumes, each feather ending in a white border tipped with black, the crest running from the base of the long, slender curved bill all the way to the back of the bird&rsquo;s head. Though colorfully and conspicuously dressed, the hoopoe is notably unclean in home and habits. Its diet of insects is obtained by probing with its sharp bill not only into the ground but also into dunghills and other filth. The nest gives off a disagreeable odor produced by secretions of the bird&rsquo;s oil glands, and it also becomes foul smelling due to the bird&rsquo;s failure to clean the nest of excrement. Thus, while not a bird of prey nor an eater of carrion, the hoopoe was included among the birds listed as unclean for food in the Mosaic Law.&mdash;Le 11:13,&nbsp;19;&nbsp;De 14:12,&nbsp;18. Found throughout southern Asia and Africa and parts of Europe, the hoopoe migrates to Palestine about the first of March and remains until the approach of winter, when it heads southward to Egypt and other parts of northern Africa. The identification of this bird with &ldquo;the lapwing,&rdquo; as in the King James Version (Le 11:19;&nbsp;De 14:18), is no longer followed by modern translations. The translators of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate understood it to be &ldquo;the hoopoe&rdquo; (e&prime;pops, LXX; upupa, Vg), and the Syriac and Arabic names for the hoopoe (Syriac, qaqupha; Arabic, hudhudu) also confirm this identification. Some believe the Hebrew name for the hoopoe (du&middot;khi&middot;phath&prime;) is intended to represent the peculiar, somewhat dovelike cry of the bird, as is clearly the case with its name in the other languages mentioned. Others would derive the name from the Hebrew verb meaning &ldquo;pound&rdquo; (compare Nu 11:8), noting the hoopoe&rsquo;s practice of probing the ground for its food. <br></div><br>

The first text repeats the prohibition against eating an animal found dead, perhaps one that was killed by wild beasts. (Exodus 22:31;&nbsp;Leviticus 22:8) The second explains what an Israelite might have done if he violated that prohibition, possibly by accident. The fact that something was prohibited by the Law did not mean that the prohibition would not at some time be ignored. For example, there were laws against stealing, murder, bearing false witness, and so forth. At the same time, there were penalties for breaking those divinely given laws. Such penalties gave force to the laws and showed how serious they were. A person who transgressed the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal found dead would be unclean in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes and would have to undergo the proper procedure for cleansing. If he failed to cleanse himself properly, he would have to &ldquo;answer for his error.&rdquo;&mdash;Leviticus 17:15,&nbsp;16. <br><br><b>w04 9/15 26</b> : 14:21&mdash;Why could the Israelites give to an alien resident or sell to a foreigner an unbled dead animal that they themselves would not eat? In the Bible, the term &ldquo;alien resident&rdquo; could refer to a non-Israelite who became a proselyte or to a settler who lived by basic laws of the land but who did not become a worshiper of Jehovah. A foreigner and an alien resident who did not become proselytes were not under the Law and could use unbled dead animals in various ways. The Israelites were permitted to give or sell such animals to them. The proselyte, on the other hand, was bound by the Law covenant. As indicated at Leviticus 17:10, such a person was forbidden to eat the blood of an animal. <br><br><b>it-1 73</b> : The alien resident who could be given the body of an animal that had died of itself was evidently one who had not become a full-fledged worshiper of Jehovah.&mdash;De 14:21. <br><br><b>345</b> : At Deuteronomy 14:21 allowance was made for selling to an alien resident or a foreigner an animal that had died of itself or that had been torn by a beast. Thus a distinction was made between the blood of such animals and that of animals that a person slaughtered for food. (Compare Le 17:14-16.) The Israelites, as well as alien residents who took up true worship and came under the Law covenant, were obligated to live up to the lofty requirements of that Law. People of all nations were bound by the requirement at Genesis 9:3, 4, but those under the Law were held by God to a higher standard in adhering to that requirement than were foreigners and alien residents who had not become worshipers of Jehovah. <br><br><b>it-2 402</b> : Boiling a kid in its mother&rsquo;s milk was prohibited under the Mosaic Law. (De 14:21) This prohibition is mentioned twice in connection with the giving of one&rsquo;s firstfruits to Jehovah.&mdash;Ex 23:19;&nbsp;34:26. It has been theorized that this practice had pagan, idolatrous, or magical connections. However, the evidence to support this view is not sound at present. Another suggestion is that this statute emphasizes that there is a proper and fitting order in matters that should be adhered to. God provided the milk of the mother for the purpose of nourishing her young. To use it to boil her offspring to prepare it to be eaten would be to the kid&rsquo;s harm and the opposite of what God had in mind when making provision for such milk. A third possibility is that this command was given in order to encourage compassion. This would be in harmony with other commands that prohibited sacrificing an animal if it had not first been with its mother for at least seven days (Le 22:27), slaughtering both an animal and its offspring on the same day (Le 22:28), or taking from a nest both a mother and its eggs or offspring (De 22:6,&nbsp;7). <br></div><br>

This meant freedom for the Hebrew slaves, many of whom had sold themselves because of debt. Such release normally would not come until the seventh year of servitude (Ex 21:2), but the Jubilee provided liberty even for those who had not yet served for six years. All hereditary land possessions that had been sold (usually because of financial reverses) were returned, and each man returned to his family and his ancestral possession. No family was to sink into the depths of perpetual poverty. Every family was to have its honor and respect. Even a person who squandered his substance could not forever lose his inheritance for his posterity. After all, the land was really Jehovah&rsquo;s, and the Israelites themselves were alien residents and settlers from Jehovah&rsquo;s standpoint.

When the Jubilee arrangement was properly observed, the nation was restored in the Jubilee year to the full and proper theocratic state that God purposed and established at the beginning. Government was on a sound basis. The national economy would always be stable, and the nation would have no crushing debt. (De 15:6) The Jubilee brought about a stable standard of land values and also prevented a great internal debt and its resultant false prosperity that brings inflation, deflation, and business depression. The Jubilee law, when obeyed, preserved the nation from gravitating to the sad state that we observe today in many lands, where there are virtually only two classes, the extremely rich and the extremely poor. The benefits to the individual strengthened the nation, for none would be underprivileged and crushed into unproductiveness by a bad economic situation, but all could contribute their talents and abilities to the national welfare. With Jehovah providing blessings of the yield of the ground and with the education that was provided, Israel, while obedient, would enjoy the perfect government and prosperity that only the true theocracy could provide.&mdash;Isa 33:22. <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec17v19'><b><a href='#c17v19'>17:19 </a></b> <br><b>w02 6/15 12-17</b> : YOU may hardly think of yourself as a king or a queen. What faithful Christian and student of the Bible would imagine himself or herself acting with royal authority, like good Kings David, Josiah, Hezekiah, or Jehoshaphat? Yet, you can and should be like them in at least one special way. What is that? And why should you want to be like them in that regard? 2 In Moses&rsquo; day, long before God approved of a human king for the Israelites, He foresaw that the desire to have a king would arise among His people. Therefore he inspired Moses to include relevant instructions in the Law covenant. These were royal instructions, directions for a king. 3 God said: &ldquo;When you eventually come into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you have said, &lsquo;Let me set a king over myself like all the nations who are round about me&rsquo;; you should without fail set over yourself a king whom Jehovah your God will choose. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it must occur that when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it must continue with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them.&rdquo;&mdash;Deuteronomy 17:14-19. 4 Yes, the king that Jehovah would choose for his worshipers was to make a personal copy of writings that you can find in your Bible. Then the king was to read in that copy daily, repeatedly. That was not a memory exercise. It was study, and it had a beneficial objective. The king who would have Jehovah&rsquo;s approval needed to pursue such study to develop and retain the right heart attitude. He also needed to study those inspired writings to be a successful, insightful king.&mdash;2&nbsp;Kings 22:8-13;&nbsp;Proverbs 1:1-4. 5 What do you think that would have entailed for David when he became king over Israel? Well, he would have had to make a copy of the books of the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). Think of what an impression it must have made on David&rsquo;s mind and heart to use his own eyes and hands to write out a copy of the Law. Likely, Moses also penned the book of Job as well as Psalms 90 and&nbsp;91. Would David have copied these too? Perhaps. Also, he would probably have had available the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. So you can see that King David would have had a good part of the Bible to read and absorb. And you have reason to believe that he did just that, for note his comments about God&rsquo;s Law, now found at Psalm 19:7-11. 6 The Greater David&mdash;Jesus, the Son of David&mdash;followed a similar pattern. It was Jesus&rsquo; custom to go to the local synagogue weekly. There he heard the Scriptures read and commented on. More than that, on occasion Jesus himself publicly read aloud from God&rsquo;s Word and explained its application. (Luke 4:16-21) You can easily get a sense of his familiarity with the Scriptures. Just read the Gospel accounts, and note how often Jesus said &ldquo;it is written&rdquo; or in other ways referred to specific passages of Scripture. Why, in his Sermon on the Mount as recorded by Matthew, Jesus quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures 21 times.&mdash;Matthew 4:4-10;&nbsp;7:29;&nbsp;11:10;&nbsp;21:13;&nbsp;26:24,&nbsp;31;&nbsp;John 6:31,&nbsp;45;&nbsp;8:17. 7 Jesus followed the counsel at Psalm 1:1-3: &ldquo;Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Everything he does will succeed.&rdquo; How that contrasted with the religious leaders of his day, who had &ldquo;seated themselves in the seat of Moses&rdquo; but who ignored &ldquo;the law of Jehovah&rdquo;!&mdash;Matthew 23:2-4. 8 Some might be puzzled, however, by one passage that could be interpreted as though Jesus were discouraging the study of the Bible. At John 5:39, 40, we read what Jesus said to some in his day: &ldquo;You are searching the Scriptures, because you think that by means of them you will have everlasting life; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me. And yet you do not want to come to me that you may have life.&rdquo; By that comment Jesus was not discouraging his Jewish listeners from studying the Scriptures. Rather, he was showing up their insincerity or their inconsistency. They realized that the Scriptures could guide them to everlasting life, but the very Scriptures that they were searching also should have led them to the Messiah, Jesus. Nonetheless, they refused to accept him. Studying was thus of no profit because they were not sincere, teachable.&mdash;Deuteronomy 18:15;&nbsp;Luke 11:52;&nbsp;John 7:47,&nbsp;48. 9 How different the picture was with Jesus&rsquo; disciples, including the apostles! They studied &ldquo;the holy writings, which are able to make [one] wise for salvation.&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Timothy 3:15) In this they were like the earlier prophets who made &ldquo;a diligent inquiry and a careful search.&rdquo; Those prophets did not consider that search to be just one zealous burst of study for a few months or a year. The apostle Peter says that &ldquo;they kept on investigating,&rdquo; particularly about the Christ and what glories were involved in his saving role for mankind. In his first letter, Peter 34 times quoted from ten Bible books.&mdash;1&nbsp;Peter 1:10,&nbsp;11. 10 Clearly, then, careful study of God&rsquo;s Word was a royal assignment for the kings in ancient Israel. Jesus followed this pattern. And studying it was an undertaking for those who would rule with Christ as kings in heaven. (Luke 22:28-30;&nbsp;Romans 8:17;&nbsp;2&nbsp;Timothy 2:12;&nbsp;Revelation 5:10;&nbsp;20:6) This royal pattern is just as necessary for all today who look forward to blessings on earth under Kingdom rule.&mdash;Matthew 25:34,&nbsp;46. 11 We can emphatically and honestly say that each true Christian should be making his or her own examination of the Bible. That is not something needed merely when you first study the Bible with Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. Each of us ought to be resolved to avoid being like some in the apostle Paul&rsquo;s day who in time slacked off in personal study. They learned &ldquo;the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;the primary doctrine about the Christ.&rdquo; Yet, they did not keep up their studying and thus did not &ldquo;press on to maturity.&rdquo; (Hebrews 5:12&ndash;6:3) We can accordingly ask ourselves: &lsquo;How do I feel about personal study of God&rsquo;s Word, whether I have been associated with the Christian congregation for a short while or for decades? Paul prayed that Christians in his day keep &ldquo;increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.&rdquo; Do I show that I have the same desire?&rsquo;&mdash;Colossians 1:9,&nbsp;10. 12 A key to your having good study habits is that you develop a fondness for God&rsquo;s Word. Psalm 119:14-16 points to regular, purposeful reflection upon God&rsquo;s Word as a means by which you come to take delight in it. Again, that is true no matter how long you have been a Christian. Underscoring that, recall the example of Timothy. Though this Christian elder was already serving as &ldquo;a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,&rdquo; Paul urged him to do his utmost in &ldquo;handling the word of the truth aright.&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Timothy 2:3,&nbsp;15;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Timothy 4:15) Clearly, doing your &ldquo;utmost&rdquo; involves having good study habits. 13 A step toward good study habits is regularly to set aside time for Bible study. How have you been doing in that regard? Whatever your honest response is, do you think that you would benefit from spending more time in personal study? &lsquo;How,&rsquo; you may wonder, &lsquo;could I arrange time for that?&rsquo; Well, some have increased their effective Bible study time by getting up a bit earlier in the morning. They might read the Bible for 15 minutes or work on a personal study project. As another possibility, what about making a slight adjustment in your weekly schedule? For example, if you are in the habit of reading the newspaper most days or watching the evening news on television, would it be possible to skip doing that just one day a week? You could use the time on that day for increased Bible study. If you replaced the news one day and devoted a time slot of 30 minutes or so to personal study, you would gain over 25 hours a year. Imagine the benefits of 25 hours of additional Bible reading or study! Here is another idea: Over the course of the coming week, analyze your activities at the end of each day. See if you can find something that could be omitted or curtailed to allow time for more Bible reading or study.&mdash;Ephesians 5:15,&nbsp;16. 14 What will make studying easier for you, more appealing? Goals. What realistic study goals could you set? For many, an admirable first goal is that of reading the entire Bible. Perhaps up till now, you have read sections of the Bible on occasion and have benefited from it. Could you now make it your determination to read the entire Bible? Your initial goal to that end might be to read the four Gospels, followed by an intermediate goal, such as then reading the rest of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Once you have the resulting satisfaction and benefits, your next goal might be a progressive reading of the books of Moses and the historical books through Esther. Accomplishing that, you will see it is realistic to complete the rest of the Bible. One woman, who was about 65 years old when she became a Christian, wrote on the inside cover of her Bible the date when she began to read it through and later the date when she finished it. She now has five pairs of dates! (Deuteronomy 32:45-47) And rather than read from a computer screen or printout, she had the Bible in her hands. 15 Some who have already met the goal of reading the whole Bible take other steps to make their ongoing study increasingly productive and rewarding. One way is to include selected study material prior to reading each successive Bible book. In &ldquo;All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&rdquo; and Insight on the Scriptures, one can find excellent information about the historical setting, style, and potential benefits of each Bible book. 16 During your study, avoid the approach common to many so-called Bible scholars. They focus excessively on analyzing texts as if the Bible were of human origin. Some of them try to fix a distinct audience for each book or to conjure up an objective and supposed viewpoint that a human author of each book had in mind. The effect of such human reasoning may be that of relegating Bible books to mere history or viewing them as reflecting evolutionary approaches to religion. Other scholars give themselves over to word studies, like the philology of Bible literature. They get more involved in studying word origins and citing Hebrew and Greek meanings than in the import of God&rsquo;s message. Do you think that such approaches are likely to impart deep and motivating faith?&mdash;1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:13. 17 Are the scholars&rsquo; conclusions even valid? Is it true that each Bible book has but one key point or is intended for one audience exclusively? (1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:19-21) The fact is that the books of God&rsquo;s Word have permanent value for people of all ages and backgrounds. Even if a book was initially addressed to one person, such as Timothy or Titus, or to a particular group, perhaps the Galatians or the Philippians, all of us can and should study those books. They are important for every one of us, and a given book may treat many themes and benefit many audiences. Yes, the message of the Bible is universal, which helps us to understand why it has been translated into the tongues of people around the globe.&mdash;Romans 15:4. 18 As you study, you will find it very profitable to seek an understanding of the Bible as well as to try to see details in their right relationships. (Proverbs 2:3-5;&nbsp;4:7) What Jehovah has revealed through his Word is intimately connected to his purpose. So as you read, relate the facts and counsel to that. You might ponder how an incident, idea, or prophecy relates to Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose. Ask yourself: &lsquo;What does this tell me about Jehovah? How does it bear on God&rsquo;s purpose being carried out through his Kingdom?&rsquo; You might also reflect: &lsquo;How can I use this information? Can I employ it in teaching or advising others based on the Scriptures?&rsquo;&mdash;Joshua 1:8. 19 Thinking of others is of benefit in another respect too. In the process of your Bible reading and study, you will learn new things and gain new insights. Try to include these in upbuilding conversation with your family members or others. If you do so at appropriate times and in a modest way, such discussions unquestionably will be rewarding. Your sincere, enthusiastic recounting of what you gained or the aspects you found interesting will likely make such more impressive to others. More than that, it will be of profit to you personally. In what way? Experts have noted that a person will longer remember what he has learned or covered if while it is fresh in his mind, he uses or repeats it, as when relating it to others. 20 Each time you read through a Bible book, you certainly will glean new information. You will be struck by passages that previously did not say as much to you. They will take on new meaning. This should underscore that rather than being mere human literature, the books of the Bible are treasures fit for your repeated study and benefit. Remember, a king, such as David, was to &ldquo;read in it all the days of his life.&rdquo; 21 Yes, those who take the time for deep study of the Bible profit immensely. They gain spiritual gems and insights. Their relationship with God becomes stronger, richer. They also become an increasingly valuable asset to family members, to brothers and sisters in the Christian congregation, and to those who have yet to become worshipers of Jehovah.&mdash;Romans 10:9-14;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Timothy 4:16. <br><br><b>w00 10/1 8-9</b> : 3 Speaking in anticipation of the time when the nation of Israel would have a human king, Jehovah said: &ldquo;It must occur that when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law from that which is in the charge of the priests, the Levites. And it must continue with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them; that his heart may not exalt itself above his brothers and that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left.&rdquo;&mdash;Deuteronomy 17:18-20. 4 Notice the reasons why Jehovah required all future kings of Israel to read the book of divine law daily: (1)&nbsp;&ldquo;in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them&rdquo;; (2)&nbsp;&ldquo;that his heart may not exalt itself above his brothers&rdquo;; (3)&nbsp;&ldquo;that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left.&rdquo; Do not Christian overseers today need to fear Jehovah, obey his laws, refrain from exalting themselves above their brothers, and avoid deviating from Jehovah&rsquo;s commandments? Daily Bible reading is surely no less important for them than it was for the kings of Israel. <br><br><b>it-2 755</b> : The kings of Israel were under divine command to write for themselves copies of God&rsquo;s law and to read it daily. (De 17:18, 19; see MEDITATION.)

Peter was standing before a crowd of worshippers in the temple. The people were &ldquo;surprised out of their wits&rdquo; when Peter and John healed a beggar who was lame from birth, and they all ran to investigate. Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah&rsquo;s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ. Then, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures, he said: &ldquo;In fact, Moses said, &lsquo;Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 3:11,&nbsp;22, 23; read Deuteronomy 18:15,&nbsp;18,&nbsp;19. 7 Those words of Moses were likely familiar to Peter&rsquo;s audience. As Jews, they had a high regard for Moses. (Deut. 34:10) With keen anticipation, they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses. That prophet would prove to be not just a messiah, an anointed one of God like Moses, but the Messiah, &ldquo;the Christ of God, the Chosen One&rdquo; of Jehovah.&mdash;Luke 23:35;&nbsp;Heb. 11:26. 8 In some respects, the earthly life of Jesus resembled the life of Moses. For instance, as babes, both Moses and Jesus escaped death at the hands of a tyrannical ruler. (Ex. 1:22&ndash;2:10;&nbsp;Matt. 2:7-14) In addition, both were &lsquo;called out of Egypt.&rsquo; The prophet Hosea stated: &ldquo;When Israel was a boy, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&rdquo; (Hos. 11:1) Hosea&rsquo;s words pointed back to the time when the nation of Israel, under its divinely appointed leader, Moses, was led out of Egypt. (Ex. 4:22, 23;&nbsp;12:29-37) However, Hosea&rsquo;s words referred not only to a past event but also to a future one. His words were a prophecy that was fulfilled when Joseph and Mary returned from Egypt with Jesus after the death of King Herod.&mdash;Matt. 2:15,&nbsp;19-23. 9 Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah&rsquo;s backing. Indeed, Moses was the first human on record to perform miracles. (Ex. 4:1-9) For example, Moses performed miracles involving water when at his command the waters of the Nile and its reedy pools became blood, the Red Sea was parted, and water came gushing out of rock in the desert. (Ex. 7:19-21;&nbsp;14:21;&nbsp;17:5-7) Jesus too performed miracles involving water. His very first miracle was that of turning water into wine at a wedding feast. (John 2:1-11) Later, he calmed the turbulent Sea of Galilee. And on one occasion, he even walked on water! (Matt. 8:23-27;&nbsp;14:23-25) Some other similarities between Moses and the Greater Moses, Jesus, can be seen in the box on page&nbsp;26. 10 Most people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but that is only part of a prophet&rsquo;s responsibility. A true prophet is an inspired spokesman for Jehovah, one who proclaims &ldquo;the magnificent things of God.&rdquo; (Acts 2:11,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;17) Among other things, his prophesying could include announcing future events, revealing aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose, or proclaiming God&rsquo;s judgments. Moses was such a prophet. He foretold each of the Ten Plagues that befell Egypt. He introduced the Law covenant at Sinai. And he instructed the nation in God&rsquo;s will. Yet, a prophet greater than Moses was to come eventually. 11 Later, in the first century, Zechariah acted as a prophet in revealing God&rsquo;s purpose regarding his son, John. (Luke 1:76) That son became John the Baptizer, who announced the coming of the long-awaited prophet greater than Moses&mdash;Jesus Christ. (John 1:23-36) As a prophet, Jesus foretold many things. For example, he spoke about his own death, foretelling how he would die, where he would die, and at whose hands he would die. (Matt. 20:17-19) To the surprise of his listeners, Jesus also foretold the destruction of Jerusalem with its temple. (Mark 13:1,&nbsp;2) His prophecies reach right down to our own time.&mdash;Matt. 24:3-41. 12 In addition to being a prophet, Jesus was a preacher and a teacher. He preached the good news of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and no one spoke with greater boldness than he did. (Luke 4:16-21,&nbsp;43) As a teacher, he had no equal. &ldquo;Never has another man spoken like this,&rdquo; said some who heard him. (John 7:46) Jesus was zealous in his efforts to spread the good news, and he inspired his followers with that same zeal for the Kingdom. Thus, he laid the foundation for a global preaching and teaching campaign that is still continuing. (Matt. 28:18-20;&nbsp;Acts 5:42) Last year, some seven million of Christ&rsquo;s followers spent about 1,500,000,000 hours in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching interested ones Bible truths. Do you have a meaningful share in that work? 13 There is no question that Jehovah fulfilled the prophecy to raise up a prophet like Moses. How does that knowledge affect you? Does it give you more confidence in the fulfillment of inspired prophecies that have to do with our immediate future? Yes, meditating on the example of the Greater Moses moves us to &ldquo;stay awake and keep our senses&rdquo; as to what God will soon do.&mdash;1&nbsp;Thess. 5:2,&nbsp;6. 14 Like Moses, Jesus was a mediator. A mediator acts as a bridge between two parties. Moses mediated the Law covenant between Jehovah and the Israelites. If the sons of Jacob obeyed the laws of God, they would remain God&rsquo;s special property, his congregation. (Ex. 19:3-8) That covenant stayed in force from 1513&nbsp;B.C.E. until the first century C.E. 15 In 33&nbsp;C.E., Jehovah initiated a better covenant with a new Israel, &ldquo;the Israel of God,&rdquo; which became a worldwide congregation made up of anointed Christians. (Gal. 6:16) While the covenant mediated by Moses included laws written by God on stone, the covenant mediated by Jesus is superior. Its laws are inscribed by God on human hearts. (Read 1&nbsp;Timothy 2:5;&nbsp;Hebrews 8:10.) Thus, &ldquo;the Israel of God&rdquo; is now God&rsquo;s special property, &lsquo;a nation producing the fruits&rsquo; of the Messianic Kingdom. (Matt. 21:43) Members of that spiritual nation are the participants in that new covenant. Still, they are not the only ones to benefit from it. Untold multitudes, even many who at present are asleep in death, will receive everlasting blessings because of that superlative covenant. 16 On their last night before the Exodus, some of the offspring of Israel were in grave danger. Soon, God&rsquo;s angel would pass through the land of Egypt, killing all the firstborn. Jehovah told Moses that the firstborn of Israel would be saved if the Israelites took the blood of the Passover lamb and sprinkled it on the lintels and doorposts of their doorways. (Ex. 12:1-13,&nbsp;21-23) So it proved to be. Later, the whole nation was in serious danger. They were trapped between the Red Sea and the pursuing Egyptian war chariots. Jehovah again provided deliverance through Moses, who miraculously parted the waters of that sea.&mdash;Ex. 14:13,&nbsp;21. 17 Great as those acts of deliverance were, the deliverance Jehovah performed through Jesus is much greater. Jesus is the means by which obedient ones are delivered from slavery to sin. (Rom. 5:12,&nbsp;18) And that deliverance is &ldquo;an everlasting deliverance.&rdquo; (Heb. 9:11,&nbsp;12) The name Jesus means &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; Jesus, as our Deliverer, or Savior, not only rescues us from our past sins but also opens the way for us to enjoy a better future. By delivering them from slavery to sin, Jesus saves his followers from the wrath of God and brings them into a loving relationship with Jehovah.&mdash;Matt. 1:21. 18 The deliverance from sin that Jesus provides will in due time include freedom from its grim effects&mdash;sickness and even death. To visualize what that will mean, consider what happened when Jesus went to the home of a certain man named Jairus, whose 12-year-old daughter had died. Jesus reassured Jairus: &ldquo;Have no fear, only put forth faith, and she will be saved.&rdquo; (Luke 8:41, 42,&nbsp;49,&nbsp;50) True to his words, the girl rose from the dead! Can you imagine the joy of her parents? Then you have an idea of the surpassing joy that will be ours when &ldquo;all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus&rsquo;] voice and come out&rdquo; in the resurrection. (John 5:28,&nbsp;29) Truly, Jesus is a Savior, our Deliverer!&mdash;Read Acts 5:31;&nbsp;Titus 1:4;&nbsp;Rev. 7:10. 19 Knowing that we can be instrumental in helping people to benefit from Jesus&rsquo; saving acts impels us to share in the preaching and teaching work. (Isa. 61:1-3) Further, meditating on Jesus&rsquo; role as the Greater Moses deepens our confidence that he will deliver his followers when he comes to execute judgment upon the wicked.&mdash;Matt. 25:31-34,&nbsp;41,&nbsp;46;&nbsp;Rev. 7:9,&nbsp;14. 20 Yes, Jesus is the Greater Moses. He did many marvelous things that Moses could never have done. Jesus&rsquo; words as a prophet and his actions as a mediator affect the entire human family. As a Deliverer, Jesus brings not temporary but eternal salvation for redeemable mankind. <br><br><b>g04 4/8 12-13</b> : We live in distressing times. Mankind certainly needs a leader like Moses&mdash;someone who has not only power and authority but also integrity, courage, compassion, and a heartfelt love of justice. When Moses died, the Israelites must have wondered, &lsquo;Will the world see the likes of him again?&rsquo; Moses himself answered that question. Moses&rsquo; writings explain how sickness and death came about in the first place and why God permitted wickedness to continue. (Genesis 3:1-19;&nbsp;Job, chapters&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2) At Genesis 3:15, the very first divine prophecy is recorded&mdash;a promise that evil will eventually be crushed! How? The prophecy indicated that an individual would be born through whom salvation would come. This promise gave birth to the hope that a Messiah would arise and deliver mankind. But who would the Messiah be? Moses helps us to identify him conclusively. Toward the end of his life, Moses uttered these portentous words: &ldquo;A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you&mdash;to him you people should listen.&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 18:15) The apostle Peter later applied those words directly to Jesus.&mdash;Acts 3:20-26. Most Jewish commentators vigorously deny any comparison of Moses with Jesus. They argue that the words of this text apply to any true prophet who came after Moses. However, according to Tanakh&mdash;The Holy Scriptures, by the Jewish Publication Society, Deuteronomy 34:10 says: &ldquo;Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses&mdash;whom the LORD singled out, face to face.&rdquo; Yes, many faithful prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, came after Moses. But none had the unique relationship with God that Moses enjoyed&mdash;speaking with him &ldquo;face to face.&rdquo; Moses&rsquo; promise of a prophet &lsquo;like him&rsquo; must therefore apply to one individual&mdash;the Messiah! It is noteworthy that before the advent of Christianity&mdash;and religious persecution from false Christians&mdash;Jewish scholars viewed things similarly. Echoes of this can be seen in Jewish writings, such as the Midrash Rabbah, which describes Moses as the forerunner of the &ldquo;latter Redeemer,&rdquo; or Messiah. That Jesus was like Moses in many ways cannot be denied. (See the box &ldquo;Jesus&mdash;A Prophet Like Moses.&rdquo;) Jesus has power and authority. (Matthew 28:19) Jesus is &ldquo;mild-tempered and lowly in heart.&rdquo; (Matthew 11:29) Jesus hates lawlessness and injustice. (Hebrews 1:9) He can therefore give us the leadership we sorely need! It is he who will soon crush wickedness and bring the earth to the Paradise conditions that the Bible describes. <br></div><br>

As you can imagine, some people might be drawn by cures and miraculously provided food. (Matthew 4:24, 25;&nbsp;8:16;&nbsp;9:32, 33;&nbsp;14:35, 36;&nbsp;John 6:26) Beyond being of physical help, however, those works actually moved observers to recognize that Jesus was the Son of God and &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; that Moses had foretold.&mdash;John 6:14;&nbsp;Deuteronomy 18:15. 13 Why was it significant that Jesus was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo;? Well, what was the key role foretold for that one? Was &ldquo;the prophet&rdquo; to be famous for performing miraculous healings or compassionately producing food for the hungry? Deuteronomy 18:18 predicted: &ldquo;A prophet I shall raise up for them from the midst of their brothers, like you [Moses]; and I shall indeed put my words in his mouth, and he will certainly speak to them all that I shall command him.&rdquo; <br><br><b>it-2 386</b> : A prophet who would perform many signs.

In many ways there was pictorial correspondency between these two great prophets, Moses and Jesus Christ. In infancy both escaped the wholesale slaughter ordered by the respective rulers of their time. (Ex 1:22;&nbsp;2:1-10;&nbsp;Mt 2:13-18) Moses was called out of Egypt with Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;firstborn,&rdquo; the nation of Israel, Moses being the nation&rsquo;s leader. Jesus was called out of Egypt as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. (Ex 4:22, 23;&nbsp;Ho 11:1;&nbsp;Mt 2:15,&nbsp;19-21) Both fasted for 40 days in wilderness places. (Ex 34:28;&nbsp;Mt 4:1,&nbsp;2) Both came in the name of Jehovah, Jesus&rsquo; name itself meaning &ldquo;Jehovah Is Salvation.&rdquo; (Ex 3:13-16;&nbsp;Mt 1:21;&nbsp;Joh 5:43) Jesus, like Moses, &lsquo;declared the name of Jehovah.&rsquo; (De 32:3;&nbsp;Joh 17:6,&nbsp;26) Both were exceptional in meekness and humility. (Nu 12:3;&nbsp;Mt 11:28-30) Both had the most convincing credentials to show that they were sent by God&mdash;astounding miracles of many sorts, Jesus Christ going farther than Moses by raising dead persons to life.&mdash;Ex 14:21-31;&nbsp;Ps 78:12-54;&nbsp;Mt 11:5;&nbsp;Mr 5:38-43;&nbsp;Lu 7:11-15,&nbsp;18-23. Moses was mediator of the Law covenant between God and the nation of Israel. Jesus was Mediator of the new covenant between God and the &ldquo;holy nation,&rdquo; the spiritual &ldquo;Israel of God.&rdquo; (1Pe 2:9;&nbsp;Ga 6:16;&nbsp;Ex 19:3-9;&nbsp;Lu 22:20;&nbsp;Heb 8:6;&nbsp;9:15) Both served as judges, lawgivers, and leaders. (Ex 18:13;&nbsp;32:34;&nbsp;Da 9:25;&nbsp;Mal 4:4;&nbsp;Mt 23:10;&nbsp;Joh 5:22, 23;&nbsp;13:34;&nbsp;15:10) Moses was entrusted with and proved faithful to his stewardship in the &lsquo;house of God,&rsquo; that is, the nation, or congregation, of Israel. Jesus showed faithfulness over God&rsquo;s house that he as God&rsquo;s Son constructed, namely, the nation, or congregation, of spiritual Israel. (Nu 12:7;&nbsp;Heb 3:2-6) And even in death there was a parallel: God disposed of the bodies of both Moses and Jesus.&mdash;De 34:5,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;Ac 2:31;&nbsp;Jude&nbsp;9. Toward the end of Moses&rsquo; 40-year sojourn in the wilderness, while he was shepherding his father-in-law&rsquo;s flock, God&rsquo;s angel made a miraculous manifestation to him in the flame of a thornbush at the foot of Mount Horeb. Jehovah there commissioned him to deliver His people from Egypt. (Ex 3:1-15) Thus God appointed Moses as His prophet and representative, and Moses could now correctly be called an anointed one, or &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; In order to come into that privileged position, Moses had had to give up &ldquo;the treasures of Egypt&rdquo; and let himself &ldquo;be ill-treated with the people of God&rdquo; and thus suffer reproach. But to Moses such &ldquo;reproach of the Christ&rdquo; was riches greater than all of Egypt&rsquo;s wealth.&mdash;Heb 11:24-26. A parallel to this is found in Jesus Christ. According to the angel&rsquo;s announcement at his birth in Bethlehem, he was to become &ldquo;a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; He became Christ, or Anointed One, after the prophet John baptized him in the Jordan River. (Lu 2:10, 11;&nbsp;3:21-23;&nbsp;4:16-21) Thereafter he acknowledged that he was &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; or Messiah. (Mt 16:16, 17;&nbsp;Mr 14:61, 62;&nbsp;Joh 4:25,&nbsp;26) Jesus Christ also kept his eye on the prize and despised the shame that men heaped upon him, as Moses had done. (Php 2:8,&nbsp;9;&nbsp;Heb 12:2) It is into this Greater Moses that the Christian congregation is baptized&mdash;into Jesus Christ, the foretold Prophet, Liberator, and Leader.&mdash;1Co 10:1,&nbsp;2. <br><br><b>697</b> : PROPHET<br></div>
