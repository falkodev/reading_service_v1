<a id='c15v12' href='#recherchec15v12'>12</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;If one of your brothers, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you and has served you for six years, then in the seventh year you should set him free. <input type='hidden' value='15:12'>13&nbsp;And if you should set him free, do not send him away empty-handed. <input type='hidden' value='15:13'>14&nbsp;You should supply him generously with something from your flock, your threshing floor, and your press for oil and wine. Just as Jehovah your God has blessed you, you should give to him. <input type='hidden' value='15:14'>15&nbsp;Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God redeemed you. That is why I am commanding you to do this today.

16&nbsp;&ldquo;But if he says to you, &lsquo;I will not go out from your company!&rsquo; because he loves you and your household, since he has been happy while with you, <input type='hidden' value='15:16'>17&nbsp;you should then take an awl and put it through his ear into the door, and he will become your slave for life. You should do the same with your slave girl. <input type='hidden' value='15:17'>18&nbsp;Do not consider it a hardship when you set him free and he leaves you, because his service to you for six years was worth twice as much as that of a hired worker, and Jehovah your God has blessed you in everything that was done.

19&nbsp;&ldquo;You should sanctify every firstborn male of your herd and your flock to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work with the firstborn of your herd nor shear the firstborn of your flock. <input type='hidden' value='15:19'>20&nbsp;You and your household should eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place that Jehovah will choose. <input type='hidden' value='15:20'>21&nbsp;But if it has a defect&mdash;lameness, blindness, or any other serious defect&mdash;you must not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God. <input type='hidden' value='15:21'>22&nbsp;You should eat it inside your cities, the unclean and clean person together, as though it were a gazelle or a deer. <input type='hidden' value='15:22'><a id='c15v23' href='#recherchec15v23'>23</a>&nbsp;But you must not eat its blood; you should pour it out on the ground like water.

Chapter <a id='c16v1' href='#recherchec16v1'>16</a> &ldquo;Observe the month of A&prime;bib, and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God, for in the month of A&prime;bib, Jehovah your God brought you out of Egypt by night. <input type='hidden' value='16:1'>2&nbsp;And you should sacrifice the Passover offering to Jehovah your God, from the flock and the herd, in the place that Jehovah chooses to have his name reside. <input type='hidden' value='16:2'><a id='c16v3' href='#recherchec16v3'>3</a>&nbsp;You must not eat anything leavened along with it; for seven days you should eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you came out of the land of Egypt in haste. Do this so that you may remember the day you came out of the land of Egypt as long as you live. <input type='hidden' value='16:3'><a id='c16v4' href='#recherchec16v4'>4</a>&nbsp;No sourdough should be found with you in all your territory for seven days, nor should any of the meat that you will sacrifice in the evening on the first day remain all night until the next morning. <input type='hidden' value='16:4'>5&nbsp;You will not be allowed to sacrifice the Passover offering in just any of the cities that Jehovah your God is giving you. <input type='hidden' value='16:5'>6&nbsp;But it should be done at the place that Jehovah your God chooses to have his name reside. You should sacrifice the Passover offering in the evening as soon as the sun sets, at the appointed time of your coming out of Egypt. <input type='hidden' value='16:6'>7&nbsp;You must cook it and eat it in the place that Jehovah your God will choose, and in the morning you may return to your own tents. <input type='hidden' value='16:7'><br><br>

<div id='recherchec15v12'><b><a href='#c15v12'>15:12 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 833</b> : This year of release, or rest from being pressed for payment of debts, did not apply to the release of slaves, many of whom would be in slavery because of indebtedness. Rather, the Hebrew slave was released in the seventh year of his servitude or on the Jubilee, whichever came first.&mdash;De 15:12;&nbsp;Le 25:10,&nbsp;54. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v23'><b><a href='#c15v23'>15:23 </a></b> <br><b>w00 10/15 30-31</b> : Occasionally, a doctor will urge a patient to deposit his own blood weeks before surgery (preoperative autologous blood donation, or PAD) so that if the need arises, he could transfuse the patient with his own stored blood. However, such collecting, storing, and transfusing of blood directly contradicts what is said in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Blood is not to be stored; it is to be poured out&mdash;returned to God, as it were. Granted, the Mosaic Law is not in force now. Nevertheless, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses respect the principles God included in it, and they are determined to &lsquo;abstain from blood.&rsquo; Hence, we do not donate blood, nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be &lsquo;poured out.&rsquo; That practice conflicts with God&rsquo;s law. <br></div><br>
