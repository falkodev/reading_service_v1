<div id='recherchec14v1'><b><a href='#c14v1'>14:1 </a></b> <br><b>w04 9/15 27</b> : 14:1. Self-mutilation shows disrespect for the human body, may be connected with false religion, and must be avoided. (1&nbsp;Kings 18:25-28) Our hope in the resurrection makes such an extreme expression of mourning for the dead inappropriate. <br><br><b>it-1 563</b> : God&rsquo;s Law specifically forbade the making of cuttings upon the flesh for the dead. (Le 19:28;&nbsp;21:5;&nbsp;De 14:1) The reason for this was that Israel was a holy people to Jehovah, a special property. (De 14:2) As such, Israel was to remain free from all idolatrous practices. Then, too, such extreme displays of mourning accompanied by self-inflicted lacerations upon the flesh were most inappropriate for a people who were fully aware of the actual condition of the dead as well as the resurrection hope. (Da 12:13;&nbsp;Heb 11:19) Also, the prohibition against self-mutilation would have impressed upon the Israelites proper respect for God&rsquo;s creation, the human body. <br><br><b>it-2 997</b> : Thus the entire nation of Israel was viewed by God as his &ldquo;son&rdquo; because of being his chosen people, a &ldquo;special property, out of all the peoples.&rdquo; (De 14:1,&nbsp;2) <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v2'><b><a href='#c14v2'>14:2 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 997</b> : Thus the entire nation of Israel was viewed by God as his &ldquo;son&rdquo; because of being his chosen people, a &ldquo;special property, out of all the peoples.&rdquo; (De 14:1,&nbsp;2) <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v5'><b><a href='#c14v5'>14:5 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 115</b> : A cud-chewing animal and a splitter of the hoof, sole mention of which is made at Deuteronomy 14:5, where it is included in the list of animals permitted to the Israelites for food. There is uncertainty as to which animal is meant by the Hebrew word di&middot;shon&prime;. The addax antelope (Addax nasomaculatus), still surviving in the desert regions of North Africa, is often suggested as corresponding to the di&middot;shon&prime; of the Hebrew Scriptures. This antelope measures about 1&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;in.) high at the shoulder. Its spreading, cloven hooves equip it admirably for travel in the loose sands of the desert, where it can survive without water for extremely long periods. The widespread horns of this animal are twisted like a screw, making from one and a half to nearly three turns, and measuring about 1&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;in.) along the curve. With the exception of the belly, tail, hindquarters, and facial markings, which always remain white, the color of the addax antelope becomes darker in winter, changing from a sandy color to brownish. Another possibility is the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), also a desert antelope. <br><br><b>426</b> : A small goatlike antelope characterized by its hook-tipped horns and noted for its agility and surefootedness at dizzying heights. The grown male may measure 80&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in.) at the shoulder and may weigh over 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lb). The summer coat of the chamois is a tawny color that gets darker with the advent of the winter season. The chamois is listed among the animals suitable for food, according to the requirements of the Law.&mdash;De 14:5. There is uncertainty as to the animal meant by the Hebrew word ze&prime;mer, which is variously rendered &ldquo;chamois&rdquo; (KJ, AS, ER, NW, Yg), &ldquo;mountain goat&rdquo; (La), &ldquo;mountain sheep&rdquo; (AT, JB, Mo, Ro), &ldquo;antelope&rdquo; (Le), and simply transliterated as &ldquo;zemer&rdquo; (Kx). The Hebrew root from which the word ze&prime;mer is derived is thought to be related to the Arabic zamara (bounce; flee), suggesting a bouncing, leaping animal, hence similar to a gazelle. Some zoologists maintain that the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) was never found in Palestine. However, it may be noted that local varieties of this animal are to be found in the Carpathian and Caucasus mountains, thus allowing for the possibility that at one time a variety of the chamois may have existed in the ranges of Lebanon. <br><br><b>966</b> : At Deuteronomy 14:4, 5, where the reference is to animals acceptable for food, the Hebrew word &#700;aq&middot;qoh&prime; has been translated &ldquo;wild goat.&rdquo; (AS, KJ, NW, RS) Many scholars believe that &#700;aq&middot;qoh&prime; may designate the same animal as ye&#701;e&middot;lim&prime;, that is, the Nubian ibex. <br><br><b>it-2 917</b> : Wild Sheep. The Hebrew word te&#700;oh&prime; has been variously translated &ldquo;wild bull&rdquo; (KJ), &ldquo;antelope&rdquo; (AS), and &ldquo;gazelle&rdquo; (Ro). However, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, by Koehler and Baumgartner (Leiden, 1958, p.&nbsp;1016), gives &ldquo;wild sheep&rdquo; as a possible rendering, and it is thus translated at Deuteronomy 14:5 and Isaiah 51:20. Wild sheep are distinguished from domestic sheep by their outer coat, which is of coarse hair rather than wool. The variety of wild sheep that is now geographically closest to Palestine is the Armenian wild sheep (Ovis gmelini), found in the mountain ridges of Asia Minor and eastern Iran. The ram of this variety measures less than 0.9&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) high at the shoulder. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v7'><b><a href='#c14v7'>14:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 555-556</b> : The Scriptural reference to the hare as a cud chewer has frequently been doubted by some critics of the Bible. (Le 11:4,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;De 14:7) It should not be overlooked, however, that the modern, scientific classification of what constitutes chewing of the cud provides no basis for judging what the Bible says, as such classification did not exist in the time of Moses. Even in the 18th&nbsp;century, English poet William Cowper, who had at length observed his domestic hares, commented that they &ldquo;chewed the cud all day till evening.&rdquo; Linnaeus, famed naturalist of the same century, believed that rabbits chewed the cud. But it remained for others to supply more scientific data. Frenchman Morot discovered in 1882 that rabbits reingest up to 90&nbsp;percent of their daily intake. Concerning the hare, Ivan T.&nbsp;Sanderson in a recent publication remarks: &ldquo;One of the most extraordinary [habits], to our way of thinking, is their method of digestion. This is not unique to Leporids [hares, rabbits] and is now known to occur in many Rodents. When fresh green food, as opposed to desiccated [dried] winter forage, is available, the animals gobble it up voraciously and then excrete it around their home lairs in a semi-digested form. After some time this is then re-eaten, and the process may be repeated more than once. In the Common Rabbit, it appears that only the fully grown adults indulge this practice.&rdquo;&mdash;Living Mammals of the World, 1955, p.&nbsp;114. Certain British scientists made close observations of the rabbits&rsquo; habits under careful controls, and the results they obtained were published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1940, Vol.&nbsp;110, pp.&nbsp;159-163. Briefly this is the way the hare reingests its food: If a rabbit eats a breakfast of fresh food, it passes through the stomach into the small intestine, leaving behind in the cardiac end of the stomach some 40 or 50 grams of pellets that were already present when the fresh food was eaten. From the small intestine the morning meal enters the caecum or blind end of the large intestine and there remains for a period of time. During the day the pellets descend, and in the intestines the bacterial protein in them is digested. When they reach the large intestine they bypass the material in the caecum and go on into the colon where the excess moisture is absorbed to produce the familiar dry beans or droppings that are cast away. This phase of the cycle completed, the material stored in the dead end of the caecum next enters the colon, but instead of having all the moisture absorbed it reaches the anus in a rather soft condition. It is in pellet form with each coated with a tough layer of mucus to prevent them from sticking together. Now when these pellets reach the anus, instead of being cast away, the rabbit doubles up and takes them into the mouth and stores them away in the cardiac end of the stomach until another meal has been eaten. In this way the special rhythmic cycle is completed and most of the food has passed a second time through the digestive tract. Dr.&nbsp;Waldo L.&nbsp;Schmitt, Head Curator, Department of Zoology of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,&nbsp;D.C., in commenting on these findings, wrote: &ldquo;There seems to be no reason to doubt the authenticity of the reports of various workers that rabbits customarily store semi-digested food in the caecum and that this is later reingested and passes a second time through the digestive tract.&rdquo; He also observed that here is an explanation for &ldquo;the phenomenally large caecum of rabbits as compared with most other mammals.&rdquo;&mdash;Awake!, April&nbsp;22, 1951, pp.&nbsp;27,&nbsp;28. <br><br><b>1035</b> : The hare was prohibited as food under the Law given through Moses and is referred to as a chewer of the cud. (Le 11:4,&nbsp;6;&nbsp;De 14:7) Hares and rabbits, of course, do not have a multichambered or multiparted stomach and do not regurgitate their food for rechewing, which characteristics are associated with the scientific classification of ruminants or cud chewers. Nevertheless, although the Hebrew term here used for chewing literally means &ldquo;bringing up,&rdquo; the modern scientific classification was not the basis for what the Israelites in Moses&rsquo; day understood &lsquo;cud chewing&rsquo; to be. Hence, there is no foundation for judging the accuracy of the Bible statement by the restricted, relatively recent conception of what constitutes a cud-chewing animal, as done by many critics. In the past, commentators with faith in the inspiration of the Bible record saw no error in the statement of the Law. Observed The Imperial Bible-Dictionary: &ldquo;It is obvious that the hare does in repose chew over and over the food which it has some time taken; and this action has always been popularly considered a chewing of the cud. Even our poet Cowper, a careful noticer of natural phenomena, who has recorded his observations on the three hares which he had domesticated, affirms that they &lsquo;chewed the cud all day till evening.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Edited by P.&nbsp;Fairbairn, London, 1874, Vol.&nbsp;I, p.&nbsp;700. Scientific observation of hares and rabbits in more recent years, however, indicates that even more than seeming cud chewing is involved. Writes Fran&ccedil;ois Bourli&egrave;re (The Natural History of Mammals, 1964, p.&nbsp;41): &ldquo;The habit of &lsquo;refection,&rsquo; or passing the food twice through the intestine instead of only once, seems to be a common phenomenon in the rabbits and hares. Domestic rabbits usually eat and swallow without chewing their night droppings, which form in the morning as much as half the total contents of the stomach. In the wild rabbit refection takes place twice daily, and the same habit is reported for the European hare. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is believed that this habit provides the animals with large amounts of B vitamins produced by bacteria in the food within the large intestine.&rdquo; On the same point, the work Mammals of the World (by E.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Walker, 1964, Vol.&nbsp;II, p.&nbsp;647) notes: &ldquo;This may be similar to &lsquo;chewing the cud&rsquo; in ruminant mammals.&rdquo;&mdash;See CUD. <br><br><b>it-2 816</b> : Some have taken issue with its classification in Scripture as a creature that chews the cud but does not split the hoof. (Le 11:5;&nbsp;De 14:7) However, zoologist Hubert Hendrichs, in observing rock badgers at the Hellabrunn Zoological Gardens near Munich, Germany, noticed that these creatures made peculiar chewing and swallowing movements. He found that rock badgers actually do chew the cud from 25 to 50 minutes a day, usually during the night. The German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung of March&nbsp;12, 1966, commented on the discovery: &ldquo;Although this fact was previously unknown to accepted zoology, it is not new. In the eleventh chapter of Leviticus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can find it.&rdquo; The claim has also been made that the hoofed toes of the rock badger are doubly cloven. However, it could hardly be said that the rock badger&rsquo;s front feet, each having four toes terminating in hooflike endings, and the hind feet, each equipped with three toes and a corresponding number of miniature hoofs or nails, resemble the foot member of a &lsquo;splitter of the hoof&rsquo; such as a cow. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v13'><b><a href='#c14v13'>14:13 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 963</b> : The Hebrew name for this bird occurs in the list of unclean birds at Deuteronomy 14:13 but does not appear in the corresponding list at Leviticus 11:14. Four Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Greek Septuagint, omit dai&middot;yah&prime; at Deuteronomy 14:13. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (dai&middot;yohth&prime;) appears at Isaiah 34:15 as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation. The identification of this bird is uncertain. It is suggested that the Hebrew name is derived from the verb meaning &ldquo;pounce&rdquo; or &ldquo;come darting.&rdquo; &ldquo;Glede&rdquo; is a suitable translation, since it is a term variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the red kite (Milvus milvus). Most modern scholars relate the Hebrew dai&middot;yah&prime; to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.&mdash;See KITE. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v14'><b><a href='#c14v14'>14:14 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 754</b> : The raven was declared unclean in the Law covenant (Le 11:13,&nbsp;15;&nbsp;De 14:12,&nbsp;14), and the phrase &ldquo;according to its kind&rdquo; is understood to embrace the crow and other apparently related crowlike birds such as the rook, the jackdaw, and the chough, all of which are to be found in Palestine. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v15'><b><a href='#c14v15'>14:15 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 1011</b> : One of the birds hunting prey or eating carrion that were prohibited as food according to God&rsquo;s law given to the Israelites.&mdash;Le 11:13,&nbsp;16;&nbsp;De 14:12,&nbsp;15. Although the King James Version renders the Hebrew name of this bird as &ldquo;cuckow&rdquo; (cuckoo), this translation has generally been abandoned in favor of sea gull (sometimes called sea mew). (See CUCKOO.) Some lexicographers understand the name to be derived from a root meaning &ldquo;be thin, slender, or lean,&rdquo; which might describe the gull from the standpoint of its trim appearance and the relative narrowness of the body as compared with the long, pointed wings. Others believe the Hebrew name sha&prime;chaph is in imitation of the shrill cry made by this generally noisy bird. The older versions (LXX, Vg) also understood it to refer to the seagoing gull. The Hebrew term sha&prime;chaph may be understood to be a generic term for a web-footed seabird resembling a gull. This group includes the true gulls, terns, skimmers, and skuas. Gulls, members of the family Laridae, are generally powerful fliers, and in addition to swimming well, they rest and even sleep on the water. The gull alternately flaps its wings, soars, wheels, and glides downward to pick up food in the form of fish, insects, and practically any kind of offal and garbage (thus serving as a valuable scavenger in ports and harbors). Herring gulls carry mussels or other mollusks up into the air and then drop them on rocks to break them open and make possible the eating of their contents. Despite its avid appetite for carrion, the gull is exceptionally clean in its habits. <br><br><b>it-2 566</b> : The Hebrew tach&middot;mas&prime; denotes a species of owl and is included in the list of &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; birds. (Le 11:13,&nbsp;16;&nbsp;De 14:15) This Hebrew word, being related to a verb meaning &ldquo;do violence,&rdquo; is appropriate to the owl, which lives by preying on small rodents and birds. This kind of owl has been identified with the striated scops owl (Otus brucei). <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec14v17'><b><a href='#c14v17'>14:17 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 512-513</b> : A large web-footed water bird that catches fish by diving. This bird appears only in the list of unclean birds under the Mosaic Law, a list that prohibits the eating of birds most of which basically are birds of prey and carrion eaters. (Le 11:17;&nbsp;De 14:17) The translators of the Greek Septuagint understood the bird to be the ka&middot;tar&middot;ra&prime;ktes, the Greek name for cormorant, while the Latin Vulgate uses mergulus (the &ldquo;diver&rdquo;) to indicate the bird. The cormorant (Phalacrocorax) is quite common in Palestine, particularly along the Mediterranean Coast and also in certain inland waters such as the Sea of Galilee. The cormorant is related to birds of the pelican family. Usually long bodied and dark colored, the cormorant is swift and agile in the water, swimming under water mainly by use of its webbed feet. Its sharp, hooked beak makes it a good fisher, and from ancient times cormorants have been trained by fishermen in the Orient and parts of India to catch fish for their owners, a band being placed fairly loosely around the bird&rsquo;s throat to prevent it from swallowing anything but very small fish. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v18'><b><a href='#c14v18'>14:18 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 1137</b> : About the size of a slender pigeon, the hoopoe (Upupa epops) is a somewhat cinnamon-colored bird, distinctively marked with alternate broad bars of white and black along its wings and back. Its most conspicuous feature is a crest of plumes, each feather ending in a white border tipped with black, the crest running from the base of the long, slender curved bill all the way to the back of the bird&rsquo;s head. Though colorfully and conspicuously dressed, the hoopoe is notably unclean in home and habits. Its diet of insects is obtained by probing with its sharp bill not only into the ground but also into dunghills and other filth. The nest gives off a disagreeable odor produced by secretions of the bird&rsquo;s oil glands, and it also becomes foul smelling due to the bird&rsquo;s failure to clean the nest of excrement. Thus, while not a bird of prey nor an eater of carrion, the hoopoe was included among the birds listed as unclean for food in the Mosaic Law.&mdash;Le 11:13,&nbsp;19;&nbsp;De 14:12,&nbsp;18. Found throughout southern Asia and Africa and parts of Europe, the hoopoe migrates to Palestine about the first of March and remains until the approach of winter, when it heads southward to Egypt and other parts of northern Africa. The identification of this bird with &ldquo;the lapwing,&rdquo; as in the King James Version (Le 11:19;&nbsp;De 14:18), is no longer followed by modern translations. The translators of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate understood it to be &ldquo;the hoopoe&rdquo; (e&prime;pops, LXX; upupa, Vg), and the Syriac and Arabic names for the hoopoe (Syriac, qaqupha; Arabic, hudhudu) also confirm this identification. Some believe the Hebrew name for the hoopoe (du&middot;khi&middot;phath&prime;) is intended to represent the peculiar, somewhat dovelike cry of the bird, as is clearly the case with its name in the other languages mentioned. Others would derive the name from the Hebrew verb meaning &ldquo;pound&rdquo; (compare Nu 11:8), noting the hoopoe&rsquo;s practice of probing the ground for its food. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v19'><b><a href='#c14v19'>14:19 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 317</b> : the Biblical record shows that, as regards their being used as food, none of the birds were designated as &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; until the introduction of the Mosaic Law. (Le 11:13-19,&nbsp;46, 47;&nbsp;20:25;&nbsp;De 14:11-20) The factors determining which birds were designated ceremonially &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; are not expressly stated in the Bible. Thus, while most of those so designated were birds of prey or scavengers, not all of them were. (See HOOPOE.) <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec14v21'><b><a href='#c14v21'>14:21 </a></b> <br><b>w05 7/1 27</b> : There is no contradiction between these two verses. The first text repeats the prohibition against eating an animal found dead, perhaps one that was killed by wild beasts. (Exodus 22:31;&nbsp;Leviticus 22:8) The second explains what an Israelite might have done if he violated that prohibition, possibly by accident. The fact that something was prohibited by the Law did not mean that the prohibition would not at some time be ignored. For example, there were laws against stealing, murder, bearing false witness, and so forth. At the same time, there were penalties for breaking those divinely given laws. Such penalties gave force to the laws and showed how serious they were. A person who transgressed the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal found dead would be unclean in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes and would have to undergo the proper procedure for cleansing. If he failed to cleanse himself properly, he would have to &ldquo;answer for his error.&rdquo;&mdash;Leviticus 17:15,&nbsp;16. <br><br><b>w04 9/15 26</b> : 14:21&mdash;Why could the Israelites give to an alien resident or sell to a foreigner an unbled dead animal that they themselves would not eat? In the Bible, the term &ldquo;alien resident&rdquo; could refer to a non-Israelite who became a proselyte or to a settler who lived by basic laws of the land but who did not become a worshiper of Jehovah. A foreigner and an alien resident who did not become proselytes were not under the Law and could use unbled dead animals in various ways. The Israelites were permitted to give or sell such animals to them. The proselyte, on the other hand, was bound by the Law covenant. As indicated at Leviticus 17:10, such a person was forbidden to eat the blood of an animal. <br><br><b>it-1 73</b> : The alien resident who could be given the body of an animal that had died of itself was evidently one who had not become a full-fledged worshiper of Jehovah.&mdash;De 14:21. <br><br><b>345</b> : At Deuteronomy 14:21 allowance was made for selling to an alien resident or a foreigner an animal that had died of itself or that had been torn by a beast. Thus a distinction was made between the blood of such animals and that of animals that a person slaughtered for food. (Compare Le 17:14-16.) The Israelites, as well as alien residents who took up true worship and came under the Law covenant, were obligated to live up to the lofty requirements of that Law. People of all nations were bound by the requirement at Genesis 9:3, 4, but those under the Law were held by God to a higher standard in adhering to that requirement than were foreigners and alien residents who had not become worshipers of Jehovah. <br><br><b>it-2 402</b> : Boiling a kid in its mother&rsquo;s milk was prohibited under the Mosaic Law. (De 14:21) This prohibition is mentioned twice in connection with the giving of one&rsquo;s firstfruits to Jehovah.&mdash;Ex 23:19;&nbsp;34:26. It has been theorized that this practice had pagan, idolatrous, or magical connections. However, the evidence to support this view is not sound at present. Another suggestion is that this statute emphasizes that there is a proper and fitting order in matters that should be adhered to. God provided the milk of the mother for the purpose of nourishing her young. To use it to boil her offspring to prepare it to be eaten would be to the kid&rsquo;s harm and the opposite of what God had in mind when making provision for such milk. A third possibility is that this command was given in order to encourage compassion. This would be in harmony with other commands that prohibited sacrificing an animal if it had not first been with its mother for at least seven days (Le 22:27), slaughtering both an animal and its offspring on the same day (Le 22:28), or taking from a nest both a mother and its eggs or offspring (De 22:6,&nbsp;7). <br></div><br>

Normally it was used and enjoyed in large measure by the Israelite family when assembling together at the national festivals. In cases where the distance to Jerusalem was too great for the convenient transport of this tithe, then the produce was converted into money and this, in turn, was used in Jerusalem for the household&rsquo;s sustenance and enjoyment during the holy convention there. (De 12:4-7,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;17, 18;&nbsp;14:22-27) Then, at the end of every third and sixth years of the seven-year sabbatical cycle, this tithe, instead of being used to defray expenses at the national assemblies, was set aside for the Levites, alien residents, widows, and fatherless boys in the local community.&mdash;De 14:28, 29;&nbsp;26:12. <br></div><br>
