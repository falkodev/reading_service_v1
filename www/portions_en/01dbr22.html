13&nbsp;So Joshua blessed him and gave Heb&prime;ron to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh as an inheritance. <input type='hidden' value='14:13'>14&nbsp;That is why Heb&prime;ron belongs to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:14'>15&nbsp;The name of Heb&prime;ron was previously Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba (Ar&prime;ba was the great man among the An&prime;a&middot;kim).

Chapter 15 The land allotted to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of E&prime;dom, the wilderness of Zin, to the Neg&prime;eb at its southern end. <input type='hidden' value='15:1'>2&nbsp;Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. <input type='hidden' value='15:2'>3&nbsp;And it extended south to the ascent of A&middot;krab&prime;bim, passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a, over to Hez&prime;ron, up to Ad&prime;dar, and went around toward Kar&prime;ka. <input type='hidden' value='15:3'>4&nbsp;Then it passed on to Az&prime;mon and extended to the Wadi of Egypt, and the boundary ended at the Sea.

A mountain in the NW corner of Judah, between the towns of Shikkeron and Jabneel, forming part of the N boundary of Judah&rsquo;s territory. (Jos 15:11) It may possibly be identified with the hill of Mughar just N of the torrent valley of Sorek and 3&nbsp;km (c.&nbsp;2&nbsp;mi) ESE of Jabneel (modern Yavne).<br></div><br>

If it is the personal name of the son of &ldquo;Arba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the father of Anak&rdquo; (Jos 15:13), the name thereafter was also applied to his progeny. (Compare Jos 15:14 with 14:15, where Arba is called &ldquo;the great man among the Anakim.&rdquo;)&mdash;See ANAKIM. <br><br><b>1083</b> : However, although the Israelites under Joshua broke the power of the Canaanites, it appears that they did not immediately establish garrisons to hold on to their conquests. Evidently while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Anakim reestablished themselves at Hebron, making it necessary for Caleb (or the sons of Judah under Caleb&rsquo;s leadership) to wrest the city from their control sometime afterward.

Evidently while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Anakim reestablished themselves at Hebron, making it necessary for Caleb (or the sons of Judah under Caleb&rsquo;s leadership) to wrest the city from their control sometime afterward.

<div id='recherchec15v17'><b><a href='#c15v17'>15:17 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 599</b> : Though Joshua&rsquo;s initial campaigns had served to subdue the unified resistance of enemy forces in the land of Canaan, rapidly demolishing all major strongholds, apparently this type of warfare did not allow for the establishing of garrisons to hold the sites of all the destroyed cities. So, a second conquest or &ldquo;mopping up&rdquo; operation was effected at Debir by Othniel, who, because of distinguishing himself in the city&rsquo;s conquest, was given Achsah, the daughter of veteran warrior Caleb, as a wife.&mdash;Jos 15:13-19;&nbsp;Jg 1:11-15. It cannot be ascertained precisely when in Israel&rsquo;s history this second conquest occurred. The book of Judges opens with the phrase &ldquo;after the death of Joshua,&rdquo; and the account of Caleb&rsquo;s taking Debir follows thereafter. (Jg 1:11-15) This, according to some, would make Judah&rsquo;s conquest of Debir subsequent to Joshua&rsquo;s death and would mean that the similar account found at Joshua 15:13-19 was a later addition to the book bearing Joshua&rsquo;s name. However, others view Judges 1:1 as only a formal introduction to connect it with the book of Joshua, arguing that Caleb would hardly wait for years until Joshua died before driving the Anakim from his promised possession. Hence, they consider the Judges account to be a restatement of that in Joshua. <br></div><br>

After David&rsquo;s victory over the Amalekite raiders he distributed portions of the spoil to the older men of the city. (1Sa 30:26,&nbsp;28) It is identified with Khirbet &#701;Ar&#701;arah (Horvat &#701;Aro&#701;er), about 17&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) SE of Beer-sheba, where the ruins of a fort remain. Some scholars believe that it may be the same place as the &ldquo;Adadah&rdquo; of Joshua 15:22, the Hebrew letter da&prime;leth (&#1491;)&nbsp;being substituted for rehsh (&#1512;)&nbsp;in both instances. <br></div><br>

This reading would drop the total number of cities in the list from 15 to the stated&nbsp;14. (Jos 15:33-36) Since such an expression would be unusual in such lists, some suggest that the text could be rendered &ldquo;Gederah or Gederothaim&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Gederah and Gederothaim.&rdquo; <br></div><br>
