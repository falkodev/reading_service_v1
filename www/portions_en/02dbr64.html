<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v20'><b><a href='#c19v20'>19:20 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 569</b> : A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10,&nbsp;12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28;&nbsp;1Ch 6:71,&nbsp;72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No.&nbsp;1209.&mdash;See RABBITH. <br></div><br><br>
