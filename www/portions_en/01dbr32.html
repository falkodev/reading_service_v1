Today's portion goes from 13:22 to 15:18.</b><br><br>

22&nbsp;Ba&prime;laam the son of Be&prime;or, the diviner, was one whom the Israelites killed with the sword along with the rest who were slain. <input type='hidden' value='13:22'>23&nbsp;The boundary of the Reu&prime;ben&middot;ites was the Jordan; and this territory was the inheritance of the Reu&prime;ben&middot;ites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='13:23'><br><br>

24&nbsp;Furthermore, Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, the Gad&prime;ites by their families, <input type='hidden' value='13:24'>25&nbsp;and their territory included Ja&prime;zer and all the cities of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and half of the land of the Am&prime;mon&middot;ites as far as A&middot;ro&prime;er, which faces Rab&prime;bah; <input type='hidden' value='13:25'>26&nbsp;and from Hesh&prime;bon to Ra&prime;math-miz&prime;peh and Bet&prime;o&middot;nim, and from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im to the border of De&prime;bir; <input type='hidden' value='13:26'>27&nbsp;and in the valley, Beth-ha&prime;ram, Beth-nim&prime;rah, Suc&prime;coth, and Za&prime;phon, the rest of the royal realm of King Si&prime;hon of Hesh&prime;bon, with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chin&prime;ne&middot;reth on the east side of the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='13:27'>28&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the Gad&prime;ites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='13:28'><br><br>

29&nbsp;Further, Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh by their families. <input type='hidden' value='13:29'>30&nbsp;And their territory extended from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im and took in all of Ba&prime;shan, all the royal realm of King Og of Ba&prime;shan, and all the tent villages of Ja&prime;ir in Ba&prime;shan, 60 towns. <input type='hidden' value='13:30'>31&nbsp;And half of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, and Ash&prime;ta&middot;roth and Ed&prime;re&middot;i, the cities of the royal realm of Og in Ba&prime;shan, went to the sons of Ma&prime;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the sons of Ma&prime;chir by their families.
<input type='hidden' value='13:31'><br><br>

32&nbsp;These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Mo&prime;ab beyond the Jordan, east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho.
<input type='hidden' value='13:32'><br><br>

33&nbsp;But to the tribe of the Levites, Moses did not give an inheritance. Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he promised them.
<input type='hidden' value='13:33'><br><br>

Chapter 14 Now this is what the Israelites took as an inheritance in the land of Ca&prime;naan, which El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel gave them to inherit. <input type='hidden' value='14:1'>2&nbsp;Their inheritance was by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses for the nine and a half tribes. <input type='hidden' value='14:2'>3&nbsp;Moses had given the inheritance of the other two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan, and to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them. <input type='hidden' value='14:3'>4&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph were considered two tribes, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and E&prime;phra&middot;im; and they did not give a share in the land to the Levites, except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their livestock and their property. <input type='hidden' value='14:4'>5&nbsp;So the Israelites apportioned the land just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<input type='hidden' value='14:5'><br><br>

6&nbsp;Then the men of Judah approached Joshua in Gil&prime;gal, and Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite said to him: &ldquo;You well know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of the true God about you and me at Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a. <input type='hidden' value='14:6'>7&nbsp;I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a to spy out the land, and I returned with a forthright report. <input type='hidden' value='14:7'>8&nbsp;Although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart, I followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:8'>9&nbsp;Moses swore on that day, saying: &lsquo;The land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons, because you have followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.&rsquo; <input type='hidden' value='14:9'>10&nbsp;Now just as he promised, Jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness; I am still here today, 85 years old. <input type='hidden' value='14:10'>11&nbsp;And today I am as strong as on the day Moses sent me out. My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. <input type='hidden' value='14:11'>12&nbsp;Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were An&prime;a&middot;kim there with great fortified cities, surely Jehovah will be with me, and I will drive them out, just as Jehovah promised.&rdquo;
<input type='hidden' value='14:12'><br><br>

13&nbsp;So Joshua blessed him and gave Heb&prime;ron to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh as an inheritance. <input type='hidden' value='14:13'>14&nbsp;That is why Heb&prime;ron belongs to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:14'>15&nbsp;The name of Heb&prime;ron was previously Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba (Ar&prime;ba was the great man among the An&prime;a&middot;kim). And the land had rest from war.
<input type='hidden' value='14:15'><br><br>

Chapter 15 The land allotted to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of E&prime;dom, the wilderness of Zin, to the Neg&prime;eb at its southern end. <input type='hidden' value='15:1'>2&nbsp;Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. <input type='hidden' value='15:2'>3&nbsp;And it extended south to the ascent of A&middot;krab&prime;bim, passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a, over to Hez&prime;ron, up to Ad&prime;dar, and went around toward Kar&prime;ka. <input type='hidden' value='15:3'>4&nbsp;Then it passed on to Az&prime;mon and extended to the Wadi of Egypt, and the boundary ended at the Sea. This was their southern boundary.
<input type='hidden' value='15:4'><br><br>

5&nbsp;The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea up to the end of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='15:5'>6&nbsp;The boundary went up to Beth-hog&prime;lah and passed over at the north of Beth-ar&prime;a&middot;bah, and the boundary went up to the stone of Bo&prime;han the son of Reu&prime;ben. <input type='hidden' value='15:6'>7&nbsp;The boundary went up to De&prime;bir at the Valley of A&prime;chor and turned northward to Gil&prime;gal, which is in front of the ascent of A&middot;dum&prime;mim that is south of the wadi, and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-she&prime;mesh and ended at En-ro&prime;gel. <input type='hidden' value='15:7'>8&nbsp;The boundary went up to the Valley of the Son of Hin&prime;nom to the slope of the Jeb&prime;u&middot;site at the south, that is, Jerusalem, and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hin&prime;nom to the west, which is at the extremity of the Valley of Reph&prime;a&middot;im to the north. <input type='hidden' value='15:8'>9&nbsp;And the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Neph&middot;to&prime;ah and extended to the cities of Mount E&prime;phron; and the boundary was marked to Ba&prime;al&middot;ah, that is, Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-je&prime;a&middot;rim. <input type='hidden' value='15:9'>10&nbsp;The boundary went around from Ba&prime;al&middot;ah westward to Mount Se&prime;ir and passed over to the slope of Mount Je&prime;a&middot;rim at the north, that is, Ches&prime;a&middot;lon, and it went down to Beth-she&prime;mesh and passed over to Tim&prime;nah. <input type='hidden' value='15:10'><a id='c15v11' href='#recherchec15v11'>11</a>&nbsp;And the boundary extended to the slope of Ek&prime;ron to the north, and the boundary was marked to Shik&prime;ke&middot;ron and passed over to Mount Ba&prime;al&middot;ah and extended to Jab&prime;ne&middot;el, and the boundary ended at the sea.
<input type='hidden' value='15:11'><br><br>

12&nbsp;The western boundary was at the Great Sea and its coast. This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides.
<input type='hidden' value='15:12'><br><br>

<a id='c15v13' href='#recherchec15v13'>13</a>&nbsp;And to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh, he gave a share among the descendants of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba (Ar&prime;ba was the father of A&prime;nak), that is, Heb&prime;ron. <input type='hidden' value='15:13'><a id='c15v14' href='#recherchec15v14'>14</a>&nbsp;So Ca&prime;leb drove out from there the three sons of A&prime;nak: She&prime;shai, A&middot;hi&prime;man, and Tal&prime;mai, descendants of A&prime;nak. <input type='hidden' value='15:14'>15&nbsp;Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of De&prime;bir. (The name of De&prime;bir was previously Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-se&prime;pher.) <input type='hidden' value='15:15'>16&nbsp;Ca&prime;leb then said: &ldquo;To the man who strikes Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-se&prime;pher and captures it, I will give my daughter Ach&prime;sah as a wife.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='15:16'><a id='c15v17' href='#recherchec15v17'>17</a>&nbsp;And Oth&prime;ni&middot;el the son of Ke&prime;naz, Ca&prime;leb&rsquo;s brother, captured it.

<div id='recherchec15v11'><b><a href='#c15v11'>15:11 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 2. A mountain in the NW corner of Judah, between the towns of Shikkeron and Jabneel, forming part of the N boundary of Judah&rsquo;s territory. (Jos 15:11) It may possibly be identified with the hill of Mughar just N of the torrent valley of Sorek and 3&nbsp;km (c.&nbsp;2&nbsp;mi) ESE of Jabneel (modern Yavne).<br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v13'><b><a href='#c15v13'>15:13 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 103</b> : The name applied to a tribe of unusually tall men and perhaps to their progenitor. At Numbers 13:22 and 28 the article is used with the name in Hebrew (ha&middot;&#701;Anaq&prime;). If it is the personal name of the son of &ldquo;Arba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the father of Anak&rdquo; (Jos 15:13), the name thereafter was also applied to his progeny. (Compare Jos 15:14 with 14:15, where Arba is called &ldquo;the great man among the Anakim.&rdquo;)&mdash;See ANAKIM. <br><br><b>1083</b> : However, although the Israelites under Joshua broke the power of the Canaanites, it appears that they did not immediately establish garrisons to hold on to their conquests. Evidently while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Anakim reestablished themselves at Hebron, making it necessary for Caleb (or the sons of Judah under Caleb&rsquo;s leadership) to wrest the city from their control sometime afterward. (Jos 11:21-23;&nbsp;14:12-15;&nbsp;15:13, 14;&nbsp;Jg 1:10) <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v17'><b><a href='#c15v17'>15:17 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 599</b> : Though Joshua&rsquo;s initial campaigns had served to subdue the unified resistance of enemy forces in the land of Canaan, rapidly demolishing all major strongholds, apparently this type of warfare did not allow for the establishing of garrisons to hold the sites of all the destroyed cities. So, a second conquest or &ldquo;mopping up&rdquo; operation was effected at Debir by Othniel, who, because of distinguishing himself in the city&rsquo;s conquest, was given Achsah, the daughter of veteran warrior Caleb, as a wife.&mdash;Jos 15:13-19;&nbsp;Jg 1:11-15. It cannot be ascertained precisely when in Israel&rsquo;s history this second conquest occurred. The book of Judges opens with the phrase &ldquo;after the death of Joshua,&rdquo; and the account of Caleb&rsquo;s taking Debir follows thereafter. (Jg 1:11-15) This, according to some, would make Judah&rsquo;s conquest of Debir subsequent to Joshua&rsquo;s death and would mean that the similar account found at Joshua 15:13-19 was a later addition to the book bearing Joshua&rsquo;s name. However, others view Judges 1:1 as only a formal introduction to connect it with the book of Joshua, arguing that Caleb would hardly wait for years until Joshua died before driving the Anakim from his promised possession. Hence, they consider the Judges account to be a restatement of that in Joshua. <br></div><br>
