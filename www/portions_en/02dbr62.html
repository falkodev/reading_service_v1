12&nbsp;But the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh were not able to take possession of these cities; the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites persisted in dwelling in this land. <input type='hidden' value='17:12'>13&nbsp;When the Israelites grew strong, they subjected the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out entirely.

14&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua: &ldquo;Why have you given us as an inheritance only one lot and one allotment? We are a numerous people, for Jehovah has blessed us until now.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:14'>15&nbsp;Joshua replied to them: &ldquo;If you are such a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Per&prime;iz&middot;zites and the Reph&prime;a&middot;im, since the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im is too cramped for you.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:15'>16&nbsp;Then the descendants of Joseph said: &ldquo;The mountainous region is not enough for us, and all the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites who are dwelling in the land of the valley have war chariots with iron scythes, both those in Beth-she&prime;an and its dependent towns and those in the Valley of Jez&prime;re&middot;el.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:16'>17&nbsp;So Joshua said this to the house of Joseph, to E&prime;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh: &ldquo;You are a numerous people, and you have great power. You will not receive only one lot, <input type='hidden' value='17:17'>18&nbsp;but the mountainous region will also be yours. Although it is a forest, you will clear it, and it will be the extremity of your territory. For you will drive away the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites, even though they are strong and have war chariots with iron scythes.&rdquo;

Chapter 18 Then all the assembly of the Israelites congregated at Shi&prime;loh, and they set up the tent of meeting there, as the land was now subdued before them. <input type='hidden' value='18:1'>2&nbsp;But there were still seven tribes left of the Israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted. <input type='hidden' value='18:2'>3&nbsp;So Joshua said to the Israelites: &ldquo;How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that Jehovah the God of your forefathers has given you? <input type='hidden' value='18:3'>4&nbsp;Give me three men from each tribe to send out; they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance. Then they should return to me. <input type='hidden' value='18:4'>5&nbsp;They must apportion it among themselves into seven shares. Judah will remain in his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their territory to the north. <input type='hidden' value='18:5'>6&nbsp;As for you, map out the land into seven shares, and bring them here to me, and I will cast lots here for you before Jehovah our God. <input type='hidden' value='18:6'>7&nbsp;But the Levites have no share among you, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad, Reu&prime;ben, and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.&rdquo;

8&nbsp;The men prepared to go, and Joshua commanded those who were to map out the land: &ldquo;Go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me, and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shi&prime;loh.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='18:8'>9&nbsp;With that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares, recording it in a book. After that they returned to Joshua at the camp in Shi&prime;loh. <input type='hidden' value='18:9'>10&nbsp;Joshua then cast lots for them in Shi&prime;loh before Jehovah. There Joshua apportioned the land to the Israelites by their shares.
<input type='hidden' value='18:10'><br><br>

11&nbsp;The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin by their families, and the territory of their lot was between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. <input type='hidden' value='18:11'>12&nbsp;On the north side, their boundary started at the Jordan, and the boundary went up to the slope of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho on the north and went up on the mountain westward, and it extended to the wilderness of Beth-a&prime;ven. <input type='hidden' value='18:12'><br><br>
