Chapter 16 And the land that fell by lot to the descendants of Joseph was from the Jordan at Jer&prime;i&middot;cho to the waters east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho, through the wilderness going up from Jer&prime;i&middot;cho into the mountainous region of Beth&prime;el. <input type='hidden' value='16:1'>2&nbsp;It extended from Beth&prime;el belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Ar&prime;chites at At&prime;a&middot;roth, <input type='hidden' value='16:2'>3&nbsp;then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japh&prime;le&middot;tites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-ho&prime;ron and Ge&prime;zer, and it ended at the sea.

4&nbsp;So Joseph&rsquo;s descendants, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and E&prime;phra&middot;im, took possession of their land. <input type='hidden' value='16:4'>5&nbsp;The boundary of the descendants of E&prime;phra&middot;im by their families was as follows: The boundary of their inheritance to the east was At&prime;a&middot;roth-ad&prime;dar, as far as Upper Beth-ho&prime;ron, <input type='hidden' value='16:5'>6&nbsp;and the boundary extended to the sea.

Chapter 17 Then the lot fell for the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, because he was Joseph&rsquo;s firstborn. Since Ma&prime;chir, the firstborn of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and the father of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, was a man of war, he received Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and Ba&prime;shan. <input type='hidden' value='17:1'>2&nbsp;And the lot fell for the rest of the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh according to their families, for the sons of Abi-e&prime;zer, the sons of He&prime;lek, the sons of As&prime;ri&middot;el, the sons of She&prime;chem, the sons of He&prime;pher, and the sons of She&middot;mi&prime;da.

5&nbsp;There were also ten allotments that fell to Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh apart from the land of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and Ba&prime;shan, which were on the other side of the Jordan, <input type='hidden' value='17:5'>6&nbsp;for the daughters of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh received an inheritance along with his sons, and the land of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad became the property of the rest of the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh.

7&nbsp;And the boundary of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh was from Ash&prime;er to Mich&middot;me&prime;thath, which faces She&prime;chem, and the boundary continued toward the south to the land of the inhabitants of En-Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah. <input type='hidden' value='17:7'>8&nbsp;The land of Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah became Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh&rsquo;s, but Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah on Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh&rsquo;s boundary belonged to the descendants of E&prime;phra&middot;im. <input type='hidden' value='17:8'>9&nbsp;And the boundary went down to the Wadi of Ka&prime;nah, southward to the wadi.

<input type='hidden' value='17:10'><br><br>

11&nbsp;In the territories of Is&prime;sa&middot;char and Ash&prime;er, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh was given Beth-she&prime;an and its dependent towns, Ib&prime;le&middot;am and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Ta&prime;a&middot;nach and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Me&middot;gid&prime;do and its dependent towns, three of the heights.
<input type='hidden' value='17:11'><br><br>

12&nbsp;But the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh were not able to take possession of these cities; the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites persisted in dwelling in this land. <input type='hidden' value='17:12'>13&nbsp;When the Israelites grew strong, they subjected the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out entirely.

14&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua: &ldquo;Why have you given us as an inheritance only one lot and one allotment? We are a numerous people, for Jehovah has blessed us until now.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:14'>15&nbsp;Joshua replied to them: &ldquo;If you are such a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Per&prime;iz&middot;zites and the Reph&prime;a&middot;im, since the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im is too cramped for you.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:15'>16&nbsp;Then the descendants of Joseph said: &ldquo;The mountainous region is not enough for us, and all the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites who are dwelling in the land of the valley have war chariots with iron scythes, both those in Beth-she&prime;an and its dependent towns and those in the Valley of Jez&prime;re&middot;el.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:16'>17&nbsp;So Joshua said this to the house of Joseph, to E&prime;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh: &ldquo;You are a numerous people, and you have great power.

Chapter 18 Then all the assembly of the Israelites congregated at Shi&prime;loh, and they set up the tent of meeting there, as the land was now subdued before them. <input type='hidden' value='18:1'>2&nbsp;But there were still seven tribes left of the Israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted. <input type='hidden' value='18:2'>3&nbsp;So Joshua said to the Israelites: &ldquo;How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that Jehovah the God of your forefathers has given you? <input type='hidden' value='18:3'>4&nbsp;Give me three men from each tribe to send out; they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance.

<input type='hidden' value='18:7'><br><br>

8&nbsp;The men prepared to go, and Joshua commanded those who were to map out the land: &ldquo;Go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me, and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shi&prime;loh.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='18:8'>9&nbsp;With that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares, recording it in a book.

9&nbsp;These became the cities appointed for all the Israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.

<div id='recherchec19v3'><b><a href='#c19v3'>19:3 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 3. A town in the Negeb region of Judah (Jos 15:29), evidently referred to as Balah in Joshua 19:3 and Bilhah in 1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:29. It was subsequently allotted to the tribe of Simeon as an enclave city. Its specific location is unknown, but evidently it lay to the SE of Beer-sheba. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v20'><b><a href='#c19v20'>19:20 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 569</b> : A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10,&nbsp;12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28;&nbsp;1Ch 6:71,&nbsp;72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No.&nbsp;1209.&mdash;See RABBITH. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v30'><b><a href='#c19v30'>19:30 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 120</b> : 2. A town within the territory of Asher but which the tribe was unsuccessful in possessing. (Jos 19:24,&nbsp;30) It is called Aphik at Judges 1:31. It has been identified with Tell Kurdaneh (Tel Afeq), about 8&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;mi) SSE of Acco. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v41'><b><a href='#c19v41'>19:41 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 304</b> : 1. A city located on the northern boundary of Judah, listed between Chesalon and Timnah. (Jos 15:10) It is evidently called Ir-shemesh (meaning &ldquo;City of the Sun&rdquo;) at Joshua 19:41, where it appears as a boundary town of the tribe of Dan, Judah&rsquo;s neighbor to the north. Judah subsequently bequeathed Beth-shemesh to the Levites as a priestly city.&mdash;Jos 21:13,&nbsp;16;&nbsp;1Ch 6:59. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec20v4'><b><a href='#c20v4'>20:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 472</b> : Legal Procedure. Upon reaching a city of refuge, the fugitive was to state his case to the older men at the city gate and was to be received hospitably. To prevent willful murderers from taking cover under this provision, the fleeing one, after entering the city of refuge, had to stand trial at the city gates in the city having jurisdiction where the killing occurred, in order to prove his innocence. If found innocent, he was returned to the city of refuge. However, his safety could be guaranteed only if he remained in the city the rest of his life or until the death of the high priest. No ransom could be accepted to alter these terms. (Nu 35:22-29,&nbsp;32;&nbsp;Jos 20:4-6) <br></div>
