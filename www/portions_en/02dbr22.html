10&nbsp;Next the third lot came up for the descendants of Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun by their families, and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sa&prime;rid. <input type='hidden' value='19:10'>11&nbsp;Their boundary went up westward to Mar&prime;e&middot;al and reached to Dab&prime;be&middot;sheth and then to the valley in front of Jok&prime;ne&middot;am. <input type='hidden' value='19:11'>12&nbsp;And it went from Sa&prime;rid eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Chis&prime;loth-ta&prime;bor and out to Dab&prime;e&middot;rath and then up to Ja&middot;phi&prime;a. <input type='hidden' value='19:12'>13&nbsp;And from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-he&prime;pher, to Eth-ka&prime;zin, and out to Rim&prime;mon, and it extended to Ne&prime;ah. <input type='hidden' value='19:13'>14&nbsp;And the boundary went around it on the north to Han&prime;na&middot;thon, and it ended at the Valley of Iph&prime;tah-el, <input type='hidden' value='19:14'>15&nbsp;and Kat&prime;tath, Na&middot;hal&prime;al, Shim&prime;ron, I&prime;da&middot;lah, and Beth&prime;le&middot;hem&mdash;12 cities and their settlements. <input type='hidden' value='19:15'>16&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the descendants of Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun by their families.

17&nbsp;The fourth lot came out for Is&prime;sa&middot;char, for the descendants of Is&prime;sa&middot;char by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:17'>18&nbsp;And their boundary was to Jez&prime;re&middot;el, Che&middot;sul&prime;loth, Shu&prime;nem, <input type='hidden' value='19:18'>19&nbsp;Haph&prime;a&middot;ra&prime;im, Shi&prime;on, An&middot;a&middot;ha&prime;rath, <input type='hidden' value='19:19'><a id='c19v20' href='#recherchec19v20'>20</a>&nbsp;Rab&prime;bith, Kish&prime;i&middot;on, E&prime;bez, <input type='hidden' value='19:20'>21&nbsp;Re&prime;meth, En-gan&prime;nim, En-had&prime;dah, and Beth-paz&prime;zez. <input type='hidden' value='19:21'>22&nbsp;And the boundary reached to Ta&prime;bor and Sha&middot;ha&middot;zu&prime;mah and Beth-she&prime;mesh, and the end of their border was at the Jordan&mdash;16 cities and their settlements. <input type='hidden' value='19:22'>23&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the tribe of Is&prime;sa&middot;char by their families, the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='19:23'><br><br>

24&nbsp;Then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of Ash&prime;er by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:24'>25&nbsp;And their boundary was Hel&prime;kath, Ha&prime;li, Be&prime;ten, Ach&prime;shaph, <input type='hidden' value='19:25'>26&nbsp;Al&middot;lam&prime;me&middot;lech, A&prime;mad, and Mi&prime;shal.

32&nbsp;The sixth lot came out for the descendants of Naph&prime;ta&middot;li, for the descendants of Naph&prime;ta&middot;li by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:32'>33&nbsp;Their boundary was from He&prime;leph, from the big tree in Za&middot;a&middot;nan&prime;nim, and Ad&prime;a&middot;mi-ne&prime;keb and Jab&prime;ne&middot;el as far as Lak&prime;kum; and it ended at the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='19:33'>34&nbsp;The boundary went back westward to Az&prime;noth-ta&prime;bor and extended from there to Huk&prime;kok and reached to Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun on the south and to Ash&prime;er on the west and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east. <input type='hidden' value='19:34'>35&nbsp;And the fortified cities were Zid&prime;dim, Zer, Ham&prime;math, Rak&prime;kath, Chin&prime;ne&middot;reth, <input type='hidden' value='19:35'>36&nbsp;Ad&prime;a&middot;mah, Ra&prime;mah, Ha&prime;zor, <input type='hidden' value='19:36'>37&nbsp;Ke&prime;desh, Ed&prime;re&middot;i, En-ha&prime;zor, <input type='hidden' value='19:37'>38&nbsp;Yi&prime;ron, Mig&prime;dal-el, Ho&prime;rem, Beth-a&prime;nath, and Beth-she&prime;mesh&mdash;19 cities and their settlements. <input type='hidden' value='19:38'>39&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naph&prime;ta&middot;li by their families, the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='19:39'><br><br>

40&nbsp;The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:40'><a id='c19v41' href='#recherchec19v41'>41</a>&nbsp;And the border of their inheritance was Zo&prime;rah, Esh&prime;ta&middot;ol, Ir-she&prime;mesh, <input type='hidden' value='19:41'>42&nbsp;Sha&middot;al&middot;ab&prime;bin, Ai&prime;ja&middot;lon, Ith&prime;lah, <input type='hidden' value='19:42'>43&nbsp;E&prime;lon, Tim&prime;nah, Ek&prime;ron, <input type='hidden' value='19:43'>44&nbsp;El&prime;te&middot;keh, Gib&prime;be&middot;thon, Ba&prime;al&middot;ath, <input type='hidden' value='19:44'>45&nbsp;Je&prime;hud, Ben&prime;e-be&prime;rak, Gath-rim&prime;mon, <input type='hidden' value='19:45'>46&nbsp;Me-jar&prime;kon, and Rak&prime;kon, with the border facing Jop&prime;pa. <input type='hidden' value='19:46'>47&nbsp;But the territory of Dan was too cramped for them. So they went up and fought against Le&prime;shem and captured it and struck it with the sword. Then they took possession of it and settled in it, and they changed the name of Le&prime;shem to Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather. <input type='hidden' value='19:47'>48&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='19:48'><br><br>

49&nbsp;Thus they finished dividing the land for inheritance by its territories. Then the Israelites gave Joshua the son of Nun an inheritance in their midst. <input type='hidden' value='19:49'>50&nbsp;At the order of Jehovah they gave him the city he asked for, Tim&prime;nath-se&prime;rah, in the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im, and he built up the city and settled in it.
<input type='hidden' value='19:50'><br><br>

51&nbsp;These were the inheritances that El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel distributed by lot in Shi&prime;loh before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished apportioning the land.
<input type='hidden' value='19:51'><br><br>

Chapter 20 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: <input type='hidden' value='20:1'>2&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell the Israelites, &lsquo;Select for yourselves the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moses, <input type='hidden' value='20:2'>3&nbsp;so that the manslayer who unintentionally or accidentally kills someone may flee there. And they will serve as a refuge for you from the avenger of blood. <input type='hidden' value='20:3'><a id='c20v4' href='#recherchec20v4'>4</a>&nbsp;He must flee to one of these cities and stand at the entrance of the city gate and present his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they must receive him into the city and give him a place and he will live with them. <input type='hidden' value='20:4'>5&nbsp;If the avenger of blood chases after him, they should not surrender the manslayer into his hand, for he killed his fellow man accidentally and he did not previously hate him. <input type='hidden' value='20:5'>6&nbsp;He must dwell in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and remain there until the death of the high priest who is in office at that time. Then the manslayer may return to the city from which he fled, and he may enter his city and his house.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<input type='hidden' value='20:6'><br><br>

7&nbsp;So they gave a sacred status to Ke&prime;desh in Gal&prime;i&middot;lee in the mountainous region of Naph&prime;ta&middot;li, She&prime;chem in the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im, and Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba, that is, Heb&prime;ron, in the mountainous region of Judah. <input type='hidden' value='20:7'>8&nbsp;In the region of the Jordan, east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho, they selected Be&prime;zer in the wilderness on the tableland out of the tribe of Reu&prime;ben, Ra&prime;moth in Gil&prime;e&middot;ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Go&prime;lan in Ba&prime;shan out of the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh.
<input type='hidden' value='20:8'><br><br>

9&nbsp;These became the cities appointed for all the Israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.

<div id='recherchec19v3'><b><a href='#c19v3'>19:3 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 3. A town in the Negeb region of Judah (Jos 15:29), evidently referred to as Balah in Joshua 19:3 and Bilhah in 1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:29. It was subsequently allotted to the tribe of Simeon as an enclave city. Its specific location is unknown, but evidently it lay to the SE of Beer-sheba. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v20'><b><a href='#c19v20'>19:20 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 569</b> : A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10,&nbsp;12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28;&nbsp;1Ch 6:71,&nbsp;72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No.&nbsp;1209.&mdash;See RABBITH. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v30'><b><a href='#c19v30'>19:30 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 120</b> : 2. A town within the territory of Asher but which the tribe was unsuccessful in possessing. (Jos 19:24,&nbsp;30) It is called Aphik at Judges 1:31. It has been identified with Tell Kurdaneh (Tel Afeq), about 8&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;mi) SSE of Acco. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v41'><b><a href='#c19v41'>19:41 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 304</b> : 1. A city located on the northern boundary of Judah, listed between Chesalon and Timnah. (Jos 15:10) It is evidently called Ir-shemesh (meaning &ldquo;City of the Sun&rdquo;) at Joshua 19:41, where it appears as a boundary town of the tribe of Dan, Judah&rsquo;s neighbor to the north. Judah subsequently bequeathed Beth-shemesh to the Levites as a priestly city.&mdash;Jos 21:13,&nbsp;16;&nbsp;1Ch 6:59. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec20v4'><b><a href='#c20v4'>20:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 472</b> : Legal Procedure. Upon reaching a city of refuge, the fugitive was to state his case to the older men at the city gate and was to be received hospitably. To prevent willful murderers from taking cover under this provision, the fleeing one, after entering the city of refuge, had to stand trial at the city gates in the city having jurisdiction where the killing occurred, in order to prove his innocence. If found innocent, he was returned to the city of refuge. However, his safety could be guaranteed only if he remained in the city the rest of his life or until the death of the high priest. No ransom could be accepted to alter these terms. (Nu 35:22-29,&nbsp;32;&nbsp;Jos 20:4-6) <br></div><br><br>
