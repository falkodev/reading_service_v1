<a id='c19v3' href='#recherchec19v3'>3</a>&nbsp;Ha&prime;zar-shu&prime;al, Ba&prime;lah, E&prime;zem, <input type='hidden' value='19:3'>4&nbsp;El&middot;to&prime;lad, Be&prime;thul, Hor&prime;mah, <input type='hidden' value='19:4'>5&nbsp;Zik&prime;lag, Beth-mar&prime;ca&middot;both, Ha&prime;zar-su&prime;sah, <input type='hidden' value='19:5'>6&nbsp;Beth-le&middot;ba&prime;oth, and Sha&middot;ru&prime;hen&mdash;13 cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:6'><a id='c19v7' href='#recherchec19v7'>7</a>&nbsp;A&prime;in, Rim&prime;mon, E&prime;ther, and A&prime;shan&mdash;four cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:7'>8&nbsp;and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Ba&prime;al&middot;ath-be&prime;er, Ra&prime;mah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Sim&prime;e&middot;on by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:8'>9&nbsp;The inheritance of the descendants of Sim&prime;e&middot;on was taken out of the allotment of Judah, because the share of Judah was too large for them.

10&nbsp;Next the third lot came up for the descendants of Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun by their families, and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sa&prime;rid. <input type='hidden' value='19:10'>11&nbsp;Their boundary went up westward to Mar&prime;e&middot;al and reached to Dab&prime;be&middot;sheth and then to the valley in front of Jok&prime;ne&middot;am. <input type='hidden' value='19:11'>12&nbsp;And it went from Sa&prime;rid eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Chis&prime;loth-ta&prime;bor and out to Dab&prime;e&middot;rath and then up to Ja&middot;phi&prime;a. <input type='hidden' value='19:12'>13&nbsp;And from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-he&prime;pher, to Eth-ka&prime;zin, and out to Rim&prime;mon, and it extended to Ne&prime;ah. <input type='hidden' value='19:13'>14&nbsp;And the boundary went around it on the north to Han&prime;na&middot;thon, and it ended at the Valley of Iph&prime;tah-el, <input type='hidden' value='19:14'>15&nbsp;and Kat&prime;tath, Na&middot;hal&prime;al, Shim&prime;ron, I&prime;da&middot;lah, and Beth&prime;le&middot;hem&mdash;12 cities and their settlements. <input type='hidden' value='19:15'>16&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the descendants of Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun by their families.

24&nbsp;Then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of Ash&prime;er by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:24'>25&nbsp;And their boundary was Hel&prime;kath, Ha&prime;li, Be&prime;ten, Ach&prime;shaph, <input type='hidden' value='19:25'>26&nbsp;Al&middot;lam&prime;me&middot;lech, A&prime;mad, and Mi&prime;shal.

<div id='recherchec19v3'><b><a href='#c19v3'>19:3 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 3. A town in the Negeb region of Judah (Jos 15:29), evidently referred to as Balah in Joshua 19:3 and Bilhah in 1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:29. It was subsequently allotted to the tribe of Simeon as an enclave city. Its specific location is unknown, but evidently it lay to the SE of Beer-sheba. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v20'><b><a href='#c19v20'>19:20 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 569</b> : A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10,&nbsp;12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28;&nbsp;1Ch 6:71,&nbsp;72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No.&nbsp;1209.&mdash;See RABBITH. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v30'><b><a href='#c19v30'>19:30 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 120</b> : 2. A town within the territory of Asher but which the tribe was unsuccessful in possessing. (Jos 19:24,&nbsp;30) It is called Aphik at Judges 1:31. It has been identified with Tell Kurdaneh (Tel Afeq), about 8&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;mi) SSE of Acco. <br></div><br><br>
