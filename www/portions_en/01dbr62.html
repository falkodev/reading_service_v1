<div id='recherchec13v3'><b><a href='#c13v3'>13:3 </a></b> <br><b>it-2 927-928</b> : Evidently the easternmost branch of the Nile River in the Delta region. Shihor, in its four occurrences in the Hebrew text, is always associated with Egypt. (Jos 13:3, &ldquo;branch of the Nile&rdquo;; 1Ch 13:5, &ldquo;river&rdquo;; Isa 23:3;&nbsp;Jer 2:18) While some commentators would equate it with &ldquo;the torrent valley of Egypt&rdquo; (Nu 34:5), usually identified with the Wadi el-&#701;Arish, SW of Gaza, Jeremiah 2:18 and Isaiah 23:3 appear to link it more closely with Egypt and the Nile than was the case with this latter torrent valley, or wadi. Particularly the Isaiah text with its reference to &ldquo;the seed of Shihor&rdquo; would seem to apply to a regularly flowing stream (na&middot;har&prime;) rather than to a seasonal one (na&prime;chal). For these reasons the Shihor, at least in these two texts, is more often identified with the easternmost arm of the Nile (after it divides into several branches upon reaching the Delta region). This position might allow for its being referred to as &ldquo;in front of [that is, on the E of or to the E of] Egypt,&rdquo; as at Joshua 13:3. This latter text, however, forms part of the description of the land that was yet to be conquered by the Israelites after the initial campaigns under Joshua, extending as far N as &ldquo;the entering in of Hamath.&rdquo; (Jos 13:1-6) Those arguing for an identification with the Wadi el-&#701;Arish point out that elsewhere the boundaries of Israel&rsquo;s inheritance are given as from &ldquo;the torrent valley of Egypt&rdquo; up to &ldquo;the entering in of Hamath.&rdquo; (Nu 34:2,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8) At Joshua 13:3, some translations (RS, NW), however, consider the reference to the Shihor (&ldquo;branch of the Nile,&rdquo; NW) to be part of a parenthetical expression giving a historical note as to how far to the SW the land of the Canaanites at one time had extended. On this basis, instead of describing the territory to be conquered, the text could simply be showing that the Canaanites once resided as far as the easternmost border of Egypt proper. Similarly, a correspondency is noted between the reference to David&rsquo;s congregating the people of Israel from Shihor (&ldquo;the river of Egypt,&rdquo; NW) to Hamath (when endeavoring to bring the ark of the covenant up to Jerusalem) and the congregating of the people in Solomon&rsquo;s day from &ldquo;the entering in of Hamath down to the torrent valley of Egypt.&rdquo; (1Ch 13:5;&nbsp;1Ki 8:65) The explanation for this may be that in the latter case (Solomon&rsquo;s time) the account gives the practical boundaries of Israelite residence. The region between the Wadi el-&#701;Arish and the eastern arm of the Nile is basically desert territory and scrubland, so this wadi, or torrent valley, fittingly marked the limit of territory suitable for Israelite inhabitation, whereas in the former case (David&rsquo;s) the description may be that of the entire region of Israelite activity, the region effectively dominated by David, which indeed ran to the border of Egypt. Even prior to David, King Saul had pursued the Amalekites as far as Shur, &ldquo;which is in front of Egypt&rdquo; (1Sa 15:7), and the dominion Solomon received through David is stated to have reached to &ldquo;the boundary of Egypt.&rdquo; (1Ki 4:21) So, even though the territory actually distributed to the Israelite tribes did not extend beyond &ldquo;the torrent valley of Egypt,&rdquo; this would not appear to argue against the identification of the Shihor with a &ldquo;branch of the Nile&rdquo; at Joshua 13:3 and &ldquo;the river of Egypt&rdquo; at 1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:5. The word &ldquo;Shihor&rdquo; does not occur at Genesis 15:18, where Jehovah promised Abraham the land from &ldquo;the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.&rdquo; So, here also, there is a question as to whether &ldquo;the river [form of na&middot;har&prime;] of Egypt&rdquo; refers to some part of the Nile or to &ldquo;the torrent valley [na&prime;chal] of Egypt&rdquo; (the Wadi el-&#701;Arish). The answer would depend upon whether Jehovah here described the actual area distributed as a tribal inheritance or referred to the whole region dominated by the Israelite kingdom at its greatest extent. If the former, then this text would likely apply to the Wadi el-&#701;Arish; if the latter, then to the Shihor.&mdash;See EGYPT, TORRENT VALLEY OF. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec13v4'><b><a href='#c13v4'>13:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 119-120</b> : 1. A town evidently N of Sidon mentioned to Joshua by Jehovah as among the places yet to be conquered. (Jos 13:4) It is presently identified with Afaka (modern Afqa) about 39&nbsp;km (24&nbsp;mi) ENE of Beirut. It lies at the source of the Nahr Ibrahim, anciently known as the river Adonis, which flows down to Byblos on the Mediterranean Coast. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec13v5'><b><a href='#c13v5'>13:5 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 902-903</b> : Jehovah included &ldquo;the land of the Gebalites&rdquo; among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua&rsquo;s day. (Jos 13:1-5) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c.&nbsp;100&nbsp;km [60&nbsp;mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and consider that the account anciently read &ldquo;the land adjoining Lebanon,&rdquo; or &lsquo;as far as the border of the Gebalites.&rsquo; However, it should also be observed that Jehovah&rsquo;s promises in Joshua 13:2-7 were conditional. Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.&mdash;Compare Jos 23:12,&nbsp;13. <br><br><b>1025</b> : &ldquo;The Entering in of Hamath.&rdquo; The oldest account we have of Hamath tells how the 12 Israelite spies in the 16th&nbsp;century B.C.E. came up from the S as far as &ldquo;the entering in of Hamath,&rdquo; an oft-repeated phrase thought to refer, not to the gates of the city itself but, rather, to the southern boundary of the territory over which it ruled. (Nu 13:21) It was to this limit that Joshua&rsquo;s conquest was pushed northward. (Jos 13:2,&nbsp;5;&nbsp;Jg 3:1-3) Some scholars, however, suggest that the expression &ldquo;as far as to the entering in of Hamath&rdquo; (Jos 13:5) should possibly read &ldquo;as far as Lebi-hamath (Lion of Hamath),&rdquo; hence a definite place.&mdash;See Vetus Testamentum, Leiden, 1952, p.&nbsp;114. The exact location of this boundary (or place) is not certain. It was reckoned as the northern boundary of Israel&rsquo;s territory (Nu 34:8;&nbsp;1Ki 8:65;&nbsp;2Ki 14:25;&nbsp;2Ch 7:8) and as bordering on Damascus. (Jer 49:23;&nbsp;Eze 47:15-17;&nbsp;48:1;&nbsp;Zec 9:1,&nbsp;2) Some think it was the southern extremity of the Coele-Syria Valley (also called the Beqa&#701;), which runs between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges. Others say it was halfway between Baalbek and Riblah. Yet others suggest it was still farther N where the pass opens up between Homs and the sea.&mdash;Eze 47:20. <br></div><br>
