I will drive them out before the Israelites. You have only to assign it to Israel as an inheritance, just as I have commanded you. <input type='hidden' value='13:6'>7&nbsp;Now you must apportion this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh.&rdquo;
<input type='hidden' value='13:7'><br><br>

8&nbsp;With the other half tribe, the Reu&prime;ben&middot;ites and the Gad&prime;ites took their inheritance that Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan, just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had given them: <input type='hidden' value='13:8'><a id='c13v9' href='#recherchec13v9'>9</a>&nbsp;from A&middot;ro&prime;er, which is on the rim of the Ar&prime;non Valley, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Med&prime;e&middot;ba as far as Di&prime;bon; <input type='hidden' value='13:9'>10&nbsp;and all the cities of King Si&prime;hon of the Am&prime;or&middot;ites, who reigned in Hesh&prime;bon, up to the border of the Am&prime;mon&middot;ites; <input type='hidden' value='13:10'>11&nbsp;also Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and the territory of the Gesh&prime;ur&middot;ites and the Ma&middot;ac&prime;a&middot;thites and all Mount Her&prime;mon and all Ba&prime;shan as far as Sal&prime;e&middot;cah; <input type='hidden' value='13:11'>12&nbsp;all the royal realm of Og in Ba&prime;shan, who reigned in Ash&prime;ta&middot;roth and in Ed&prime;re&middot;i.

14&nbsp;It was only to the tribe of the Levites that he did not give an inheritance. The offerings made by fire to Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance, just as he promised them.

15&nbsp;Then Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reu&prime;ben&middot;ites by their families, <input type='hidden' value='13:15'><a id='c13v16' href='#recherchec13v16'>16</a>&nbsp;and their territory was from A&middot;ro&prime;er, which is on the rim of the Ar&prime;non Valley, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Med&prime;e&middot;ba; <input type='hidden' value='13:16'>17&nbsp;Hesh&prime;bon and all its towns on the tableland, Di&prime;bon, Ba&prime;moth-ba&prime;al, Beth-ba&prime;al-me&prime;on, <input type='hidden' value='13:17'>18&nbsp;Ja&prime;haz, Ked&prime;e&middot;moth, Meph&prime;a&middot;ath, <input type='hidden' value='13:18'>19&nbsp;Kir&middot;i&middot;a&middot;tha&prime;im, Sib&prime;mah, and Ze&prime;reth-sha&prime;har on the mountain of the valley, <input type='hidden' value='13:19'>20&nbsp;Beth-pe&prime;or, the slopes of Pis&prime;gah, Beth-jesh&prime;i&middot;moth, <input type='hidden' value='13:20'><a id='c13v21' href='#recherchec13v21'>21</a>&nbsp;all the cities of the tableland, and all the royal realm of King Si&prime;hon of the Am&prime;or&middot;ites, who reigned in Hesh&prime;bon.

24&nbsp;Furthermore, Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, the Gad&prime;ites by their families, <input type='hidden' value='13:24'>25&nbsp;and their territory included Ja&prime;zer and all the cities of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and half of the land of the Am&prime;mon&middot;ites as far as A&middot;ro&prime;er, which faces Rab&prime;bah; <input type='hidden' value='13:25'>26&nbsp;and from Hesh&prime;bon to Ra&prime;math-miz&prime;peh and Bet&prime;o&middot;nim, and from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im to the border of De&prime;bir; <input type='hidden' value='13:26'>27&nbsp;and in the valley, Beth-ha&prime;ram, Beth-nim&prime;rah, Suc&prime;coth, and Za&prime;phon, the rest of the royal realm of King Si&prime;hon of Hesh&prime;bon, with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chin&prime;ne&middot;reth on the east side of the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='13:27'>28&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the Gad&prime;ites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.

29&nbsp;Further, Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh by their families. <input type='hidden' value='13:29'>30&nbsp;And their territory extended from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im and took in all of Ba&prime;shan, all the royal realm of King Og of Ba&prime;shan, and all the tent villages of Ja&prime;ir in Ba&prime;shan, 60 towns. <input type='hidden' value='13:30'><br><br>

<div id='recherchec13v4'><b><a href='#c13v4'>13:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 119-120</b> : 1. A town evidently N of Sidon mentioned to Joshua by Jehovah as among the places yet to be conquered. (Jos 13:4) It is presently identified with Afaka (modern Afqa) about 39&nbsp;km (24&nbsp;mi) ENE of Beirut. It lies at the source of the Nahr Ibrahim, anciently known as the river Adonis, which flows down to Byblos on the Mediterranean Coast. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec13v5'><b><a href='#c13v5'>13:5 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 902-903</b> : Jehovah included &ldquo;the land of the Gebalites&rdquo; among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua&rsquo;s day. (Jos 13:1-5) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c.&nbsp;100&nbsp;km [60&nbsp;mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and consider that the account anciently read &ldquo;the land adjoining Lebanon,&rdquo; or &lsquo;as far as the border of the Gebalites.&rsquo; However, it should also be observed that Jehovah&rsquo;s promises in Joshua 13:2-7 were conditional. Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.&mdash;Compare Jos 23:12,&nbsp;13. <br><br><b>1025</b> : &ldquo;The Entering in of Hamath.&rdquo; The oldest account we have of Hamath tells how the 12 Israelite spies in the 16th&nbsp;century B.C.E. came up from the S as far as &ldquo;the entering in of Hamath,&rdquo; an oft-repeated phrase thought to refer, not to the gates of the city itself but, rather, to the southern boundary of the territory over which it ruled. (Nu 13:21) It was to this limit that Joshua&rsquo;s conquest was pushed northward. (Jos 13:2,&nbsp;5;&nbsp;Jg 3:1-3) Some scholars, however, suggest that the expression &ldquo;as far as to the entering in of Hamath&rdquo; (Jos 13:5) should possibly read &ldquo;as far as Lebi-hamath (Lion of Hamath),&rdquo; hence a definite place.&mdash;See Vetus Testamentum, Leiden, 1952, p.&nbsp;114. The exact location of this boundary (or place) is not certain. It was reckoned as the northern boundary of Israel&rsquo;s territory (Nu 34:8;&nbsp;1Ki 8:65;&nbsp;2Ki 14:25;&nbsp;2Ch 7:8) and as bordering on Damascus. (Jer 49:23;&nbsp;Eze 47:15-17;&nbsp;48:1;&nbsp;Zec 9:1,&nbsp;2) Some think it was the southern extremity of the Coele-Syria Valley (also called the Beqa&#701;), which runs between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges. Others say it was halfway between Baalbek and Riblah. Yet others suggest it was still farther N where the pass opens up between Homs and the sea.&mdash;Eze 47:20. <br></div><br>
