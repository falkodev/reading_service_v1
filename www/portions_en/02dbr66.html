Today's portion goes from 19:42 to 20:9.</b><br><br>

42&nbsp;Sha&middot;al&middot;ab&prime;bin, Ai&prime;ja&middot;lon, Ith&prime;lah, <input type='hidden' value='19:42'>43&nbsp;E&prime;lon, Tim&prime;nah, Ek&prime;ron, <input type='hidden' value='19:43'>44&nbsp;El&prime;te&middot;keh, Gib&prime;be&middot;thon, Ba&prime;al&middot;ath, <input type='hidden' value='19:44'>45&nbsp;Je&prime;hud, Ben&prime;e-be&prime;rak, Gath-rim&prime;mon, <input type='hidden' value='19:45'>46&nbsp;Me-jar&prime;kon, and Rak&prime;kon, with the border facing Jop&prime;pa. <input type='hidden' value='19:46'>47&nbsp;But the territory of Dan was too cramped for them. So they went up and fought against Le&prime;shem and captured it and struck it with the sword. Then they took possession of it and settled in it, and they changed the name of Le&prime;shem to Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather. <input type='hidden' value='19:47'>48&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='19:48'><br><br>

49&nbsp;Thus they finished dividing the land for inheritance by its territories. Then the Israelites gave Joshua the son of Nun an inheritance in their midst. <input type='hidden' value='19:49'>50&nbsp;At the order of Jehovah they gave him the city he asked for, Tim&prime;nath-se&prime;rah, in the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im, and he built up the city and settled in it.
<input type='hidden' value='19:50'><br><br>

51&nbsp;These were the inheritances that El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel distributed by lot in Shi&prime;loh before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished apportioning the land.
<input type='hidden' value='19:51'><br><br>

Chapter 20 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: <input type='hidden' value='20:1'>2&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell the Israelites, &lsquo;Select for yourselves the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moses, <input type='hidden' value='20:2'>3&nbsp;so that the manslayer who unintentionally or accidentally kills someone may flee there. And they will serve as a refuge for you from the avenger of blood. <input type='hidden' value='20:3'><a id='c20v4' href='#recherchec20v4'>4</a>&nbsp;He must flee to one of these cities and stand at the entrance of the city gate and present his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they must receive him into the city and give him a place and he will live with them. <input type='hidden' value='20:4'>5&nbsp;If the avenger of blood chases after him, they should not surrender the manslayer into his hand, for he killed his fellow man accidentally and he did not previously hate him. <input type='hidden' value='20:5'>6&nbsp;He must dwell in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and remain there until the death of the high priest who is in office at that time. Then the manslayer may return to the city from which he fled, and he may enter his city and his house.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<input type='hidden' value='20:6'><br><br>

7&nbsp;So they gave a sacred status to Ke&prime;desh in Gal&prime;i&middot;lee in the mountainous region of Naph&prime;ta&middot;li, She&prime;chem in the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im, and Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba, that is, Heb&prime;ron, in the mountainous region of Judah. <input type='hidden' value='20:7'>8&nbsp;In the region of the Jordan, east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho, they selected Be&prime;zer in the wilderness on the tableland out of the tribe of Reu&prime;ben, Ra&prime;moth in Gil&prime;e&middot;ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Go&prime;lan in Ba&prime;shan out of the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh.
<input type='hidden' value='20:8'><br><br>

9&nbsp;These became the cities appointed for all the Israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.

<div id='recherchec20v4'><b><a href='#c20v4'>20:4 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 472</b> : Legal Procedure. Upon reaching a city of refuge, the fugitive was to state his case to the older men at the city gate and was to be received hospitably. To prevent willful murderers from taking cover under this provision, the fleeing one, after entering the city of refuge, had to stand trial at the city gates in the city having jurisdiction where the killing occurred, in order to prove his innocence. If found innocent, he was returned to the city of refuge. However, his safety could be guaranteed only if he remained in the city the rest of his life or until the death of the high priest. No ransom could be accepted to alter these terms. (Nu 35:22-29,&nbsp;32;&nbsp;Jos 20:4-6) <br></div><br><br>
