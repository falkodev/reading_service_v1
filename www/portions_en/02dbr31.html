Chapter 16 And the land that fell by lot to the descendants of Joseph was from the Jordan at Jer&prime;i&middot;cho to the waters east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho, through the wilderness going up from Jer&prime;i&middot;cho into the mountainous region of Beth&prime;el. <input type='hidden' value='16:1'>2&nbsp;It extended from Beth&prime;el belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Ar&prime;chites at At&prime;a&middot;roth, <input type='hidden' value='16:2'>3&nbsp;then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japh&prime;le&middot;tites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-ho&prime;ron and Ge&prime;zer, and it ended at the sea.
<input type='hidden' value='16:3'><br><br>

4&nbsp;So Joseph&rsquo;s descendants, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and E&prime;phra&middot;im, took possession of their land. <input type='hidden' value='16:4'>5&nbsp;The boundary of the descendants of E&prime;phra&middot;im by their families was as follows: The boundary of their inheritance to the east was At&prime;a&middot;roth-ad&prime;dar, as far as Upper Beth-ho&prime;ron, <input type='hidden' value='16:5'>6&nbsp;and the boundary extended to the sea. Mich&middot;me&prime;thath was on the north, and the boundary went around east to Ta&prime;a&middot;nath-shi&prime;loh, and it passed on the east to Ja&middot;no&prime;ah. <input type='hidden' value='16:6'>7&nbsp;Then it went down from Ja&middot;no&prime;ah to At&prime;a&middot;roth and Na&prime;a&middot;rah and reached to Jer&prime;i&middot;cho and extended to the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='16:7'>8&nbsp;From Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah the boundary continued westward to the Wadi of Ka&prime;nah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of E&prime;phra&middot;im by their families; <input type='hidden' value='16:8'>9&nbsp;the descendants of E&prime;phra&middot;im also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, all the cities and their settlements.
<input type='hidden' value='16:9'><br><br>

10&nbsp;But they did not drive away the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites who were dwelling in Ge&prime;zer, and the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites continue to dwell among E&prime;phra&middot;im to this day and have been subjected to forced labor.

Chapter 17 Then the lot fell for the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, because he was Joseph&rsquo;s firstborn. Since Ma&prime;chir, the firstborn of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and the father of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, was a man of war, he received Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and Ba&prime;shan. <input type='hidden' value='17:1'>2&nbsp;And the lot fell for the rest of the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh according to their families, for the sons of Abi-e&prime;zer, the sons of He&prime;lek, the sons of As&prime;ri&middot;el, the sons of She&prime;chem, the sons of He&prime;pher, and the sons of She&middot;mi&prime;da. These were the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh the son of Joseph, the males according to their families. <input type='hidden' value='17:2'>3&nbsp;But Ze&middot;lo&prime;phe&middot;had the son of He&prime;pher, the son of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, the son of Ma&prime;chir, the son of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, did not have sons, only daughters, and these were the names of his daughters: Mah&prime;lah, Noah, Hog&prime;lah, Mil&prime;cah, and Tir&prime;zah. <input type='hidden' value='17:3'>4&nbsp;So they presented themselves before El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the chieftains, saying: &ldquo;It was Jehovah who commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.&rdquo; So at the order of Jehovah, he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
<input type='hidden' value='17:4'><br><br>

5&nbsp;There were also ten allotments that fell to Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh apart from the land of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and Ba&prime;shan, which were on the other side of the Jordan, <input type='hidden' value='17:5'>6&nbsp;for the daughters of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh received an inheritance along with his sons, and the land of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad became the property of the rest of the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh.
<input type='hidden' value='17:6'><br><br>

7&nbsp;And the boundary of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh was from Ash&prime;er to Mich&middot;me&prime;thath, which faces She&prime;chem, and the boundary continued toward the south to the land of the inhabitants of En-Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah. <input type='hidden' value='17:7'>8&nbsp;The land of Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah became Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh&rsquo;s, but Tap&prime;pu&middot;ah on Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh&rsquo;s boundary belonged to the descendants of E&prime;phra&middot;im. <input type='hidden' value='17:8'>9&nbsp;And the boundary went down to the Wadi of Ka&prime;nah, southward to the wadi. There were cities of E&prime;phra&middot;im among the cities of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, and the boundary of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh was on the north of the wadi, and it ended at the sea. <input type='hidden' value='17:9'>10&nbsp;To the south it belonged to E&prime;phra&middot;im, and to the north it belonged to Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, and the sea was his boundary, and on the north they reached to Ash&prime;er, and on the east, to Is&prime;sa&middot;char.
<input type='hidden' value='17:10'><br><br>

11&nbsp;In the territories of Is&prime;sa&middot;char and Ash&prime;er, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh was given Beth-she&prime;an and its dependent towns, Ib&prime;le&middot;am and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Ta&prime;a&middot;nach and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Me&middot;gid&prime;do and its dependent towns, three of the heights.
<input type='hidden' value='17:11'><br><br>

12&nbsp;But the descendants of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh were not able to take possession of these cities; the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites persisted in dwelling in this land. <input type='hidden' value='17:12'>13&nbsp;When the Israelites grew strong, they subjected the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out entirely.
<input type='hidden' value='17:13'><br><br>

14&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua: &ldquo;Why have you given us as an inheritance only one lot and one allotment? We are a numerous people, for Jehovah has blessed us until now.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:14'>15&nbsp;Joshua replied to them: &ldquo;If you are such a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Per&prime;iz&middot;zites and the Reph&prime;a&middot;im, since the mountainous region of E&prime;phra&middot;im is too cramped for you.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:15'>16&nbsp;Then the descendants of Joseph said: &ldquo;The mountainous region is not enough for us, and all the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites who are dwelling in the land of the valley have war chariots with iron scythes, both those in Beth-she&prime;an and its dependent towns and those in the Valley of Jez&prime;re&middot;el.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='17:16'>17&nbsp;So Joshua said this to the house of Joseph, to E&prime;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh: &ldquo;You are a numerous people, and you have great power. You will not receive only one lot, <input type='hidden' value='17:17'>18&nbsp;but the mountainous region will also be yours. Although it is a forest, you will clear it, and it will be the extremity of your territory. For you will drive away the Ca&prime;naan&middot;ites, even though they are strong and have war chariots with iron scythes.&rdquo;

Chapter 18 Then all the assembly of the Israelites congregated at Shi&prime;loh, and they set up the tent of meeting there, as the land was now subdued before them. <input type='hidden' value='18:1'>2&nbsp;But there were still seven tribes left of the Israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted. <input type='hidden' value='18:2'>3&nbsp;So Joshua said to the Israelites: &ldquo;How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that Jehovah the God of your forefathers has given you? <input type='hidden' value='18:3'>4&nbsp;Give me three men from each tribe to send out; they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance. Then they should return to me. <input type='hidden' value='18:4'>5&nbsp;They must apportion it among themselves into seven shares. Judah will remain in his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their territory to the north. <input type='hidden' value='18:5'>6&nbsp;As for you, map out the land into seven shares, and bring them here to me, and I will cast lots here for you before Jehovah our God. <input type='hidden' value='18:6'>7&nbsp;But the Levites have no share among you, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad, Reu&prime;ben, and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.&rdquo;
<input type='hidden' value='18:7'><br><br>

8&nbsp;The men prepared to go, and Joshua commanded those who were to map out the land: &ldquo;Go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me, and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shi&prime;loh.&rdquo; <input type='hidden' value='18:8'>9&nbsp;With that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares, recording it in a book. After that they returned to Joshua at the camp in Shi&prime;loh. <input type='hidden' value='18:9'>10&nbsp;Joshua then cast lots for them in Shi&prime;loh before Jehovah. There Joshua apportioned the land to the Israelites by their shares.
<input type='hidden' value='18:10'><br><br>

11&nbsp;The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin by their families, and the territory of their lot was between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. <input type='hidden' value='18:11'>12&nbsp;On the north side, their boundary started at the Jordan, and the boundary went up to the slope of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho on the north and went up on the mountain westward, and it extended to the wilderness of Beth-a&prime;ven. <input type='hidden' value='18:12'><br><br>
