14&nbsp;It was only to the tribe of the Levites that he did not give an inheritance. The offerings made by fire to Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance, just as he promised them.

15&nbsp;Then Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reu&prime;ben&middot;ites by their families, <input type='hidden' value='13:15'><a id='c13v16' href='#recherchec13v16'>16</a>&nbsp;and their territory was from A&middot;ro&prime;er, which is on the rim of the Ar&prime;non Valley, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Med&prime;e&middot;ba; <input type='hidden' value='13:16'>17&nbsp;Hesh&prime;bon and all its towns on the tableland, Di&prime;bon, Ba&prime;moth-ba&prime;al, Beth-ba&prime;al-me&prime;on, <input type='hidden' value='13:17'>18&nbsp;Ja&prime;haz, Ked&prime;e&middot;moth, Meph&prime;a&middot;ath, <input type='hidden' value='13:18'>19&nbsp;Kir&middot;i&middot;a&middot;tha&prime;im, Sib&prime;mah, and Ze&prime;reth-sha&prime;har on the mountain of the valley, <input type='hidden' value='13:19'>20&nbsp;Beth-pe&prime;or, the slopes of Pis&prime;gah, Beth-jesh&prime;i&middot;moth, <input type='hidden' value='13:20'><a id='c13v21' href='#recherchec13v21'>21</a>&nbsp;all the cities of the tableland, and all the royal realm of King Si&prime;hon of the Am&prime;or&middot;ites, who reigned in Hesh&prime;bon.

24&nbsp;Furthermore, Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, the Gad&prime;ites by their families, <input type='hidden' value='13:24'>25&nbsp;and their territory included Ja&prime;zer and all the cities of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad and half of the land of the Am&prime;mon&middot;ites as far as A&middot;ro&prime;er, which faces Rab&prime;bah; <input type='hidden' value='13:25'>26&nbsp;and from Hesh&prime;bon to Ra&prime;math-miz&prime;peh and Bet&prime;o&middot;nim, and from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im to the border of De&prime;bir; <input type='hidden' value='13:26'>27&nbsp;and in the valley, Beth-ha&prime;ram, Beth-nim&prime;rah, Suc&prime;coth, and Za&prime;phon, the rest of the royal realm of King Si&prime;hon of Hesh&prime;bon, with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chin&prime;ne&middot;reth on the east side of the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='13:27'>28&nbsp;This was the inheritance of the Gad&prime;ites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.

29&nbsp;Further, Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh by their families. <input type='hidden' value='13:29'>30&nbsp;And their territory extended from Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&prime;im and took in all of Ba&prime;shan, all the royal realm of King Og of Ba&prime;shan, and all the tent villages of Ja&prime;ir in Ba&prime;shan, 60 towns. <input type='hidden' value='13:30'>31&nbsp;And half of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, and Ash&prime;ta&middot;roth and Ed&prime;re&middot;i, the cities of the royal realm of Og in Ba&prime;shan, went to the sons of Ma&prime;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the sons of Ma&prime;chir by their families.

32&nbsp;These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Mo&prime;ab beyond the Jordan, east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho.
<input type='hidden' value='13:32'><br><br>

33&nbsp;But to the tribe of the Levites, Moses did not give an inheritance. Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he promised them.

Chapter 14 Now this is what the Israelites took as an inheritance in the land of Ca&prime;naan, which El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel gave them to inherit. <input type='hidden' value='14:1'>2&nbsp;Their inheritance was by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses for the nine and a half tribes. <input type='hidden' value='14:2'>3&nbsp;Moses had given the inheritance of the other two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan, and to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them. <input type='hidden' value='14:3'>4&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph were considered two tribes, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and E&prime;phra&middot;im; and they did not give a share in the land to the Levites, except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their livestock and their property. <input type='hidden' value='14:4'>5&nbsp;So the Israelites apportioned the land just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<input type='hidden' value='14:5'><br><br>

6&nbsp;Then the men of Judah approached Joshua in Gil&prime;gal, and Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite said to him: &ldquo;You well know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of the true God about you and me at Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a. <input type='hidden' value='14:6'>7&nbsp;I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a to spy out the land, and I returned with a forthright report. <input type='hidden' value='14:7'>8&nbsp;Although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart, I followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:8'>9&nbsp;Moses swore on that day, saying: &lsquo;The land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons, because you have followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.&rsquo; <input type='hidden' value='14:9'>10&nbsp;Now just as he promised, Jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness; I am still here today, 85 years old. <input type='hidden' value='14:10'>11&nbsp;And today I am as strong as on the day Moses sent me out. My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. <input type='hidden' value='14:11'>12&nbsp;Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were An&prime;a&middot;kim there with great fortified cities, surely Jehovah will be with me, and I will drive them out, just as Jehovah promised.&rdquo;
