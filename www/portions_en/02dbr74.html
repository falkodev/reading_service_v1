Chapter 19 Then the second lot came out for Sim&prime;e&middot;on, for the tribe of Sim&prime;e&middot;on by their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah. <input type='hidden' value='19:1'>2&nbsp;Their inheritance was Be&prime;er-she&prime;ba with She&prime;ba, Mo&middot;la&prime;dah, <input type='hidden' value='19:2'><a id='c19v3' href='#recherchec19v3'>3</a>&nbsp;Ha&prime;zar-shu&prime;al, Ba&prime;lah, E&prime;zem, <input type='hidden' value='19:3'>4&nbsp;El&middot;to&prime;lad, Be&prime;thul, Hor&prime;mah, <input type='hidden' value='19:4'>5&nbsp;Zik&prime;lag, Beth-mar&prime;ca&middot;both, Ha&prime;zar-su&prime;sah, <input type='hidden' value='19:5'>6&nbsp;Beth-le&middot;ba&prime;oth, and Sha&middot;ru&prime;hen&mdash;13 cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:6'><a id='c19v7' href='#recherchec19v7'>7</a>&nbsp;A&prime;in, Rim&prime;mon, E&prime;ther, and A&prime;shan&mdash;four cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:7'>8&nbsp;and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Ba&prime;al&middot;ath-be&prime;er, Ra&prime;mah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Sim&prime;e&middot;on by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:8'>9&nbsp;The inheritance of the descendants of Sim&prime;e&middot;on was taken out of the allotment of Judah, because the share of Judah was too large for them. So the descendants of Sim&prime;e&middot;on received a possession within their inheritance.

10&nbsp;Next the third lot came up for the descendants of Zeb&prime;u&middot;lun by their families, and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sa&prime;rid. <input type='hidden' value='19:10'>11&nbsp;Their boundary went up westward to Mar&prime;e&middot;al and reached to Dab&prime;be&middot;sheth and then to the valley in front of Jok&prime;ne&middot;am. <input type='hidden' value='19:11'>12&nbsp;And it went from Sa&prime;rid eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Chis&prime;loth-ta&prime;bor and out to Dab&prime;e&middot;rath and then up to Ja&middot;phi&prime;a. <input type='hidden' value='19:12'><br><br>

A town in the Negeb region of Judah (Jos 15:29), evidently referred to as Balah in Joshua 19:3 and Bilhah in 1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:29. It was subsequently allotted to the tribe of Simeon as an enclave city. Its specific location is unknown, but evidently it lay to the SE of Beer-sheba. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br><br>
