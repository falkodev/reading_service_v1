Today's portion goes from 13:31 to 15:9.</b><br><br>

31&nbsp;And half of Gil&prime;e&middot;ad, and Ash&prime;ta&middot;roth and Ed&prime;re&middot;i, the cities of the royal realm of Og in Ba&prime;shan, went to the sons of Ma&prime;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh, to half of the sons of Ma&prime;chir by their families.

32&nbsp;These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Mo&prime;ab beyond the Jordan, east of Jer&prime;i&middot;cho.
<input type='hidden' value='13:32'><br><br>

33&nbsp;But to the tribe of the Levites, Moses did not give an inheritance. Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he promised them.
<input type='hidden' value='13:33'><br><br>

Chapter 14 Now this is what the Israelites took as an inheritance in the land of Ca&prime;naan, which El&middot;e&middot;a&prime;zar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel gave them to inherit. <input type='hidden' value='14:1'>2&nbsp;Their inheritance was by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses for the nine and a half tribes. <input type='hidden' value='14:2'>3&nbsp;Moses had given the inheritance of the other two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan, and to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them. <input type='hidden' value='14:3'>4&nbsp;The descendants of Joseph were considered two tribes, Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh and E&prime;phra&middot;im; and they did not give a share in the land to the Levites, except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their livestock and their property. <input type='hidden' value='14:4'>5&nbsp;So the Israelites apportioned the land just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<input type='hidden' value='14:5'><br><br>

6&nbsp;Then the men of Judah approached Joshua in Gil&prime;gal, and Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite said to him: &ldquo;You well know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of the true God about you and me at Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a. <input type='hidden' value='14:6'>7&nbsp;I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a to spy out the land, and I returned with a forthright report. <input type='hidden' value='14:7'>8&nbsp;Although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart, I followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:8'>9&nbsp;Moses swore on that day, saying: &lsquo;The land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons, because you have followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.&rsquo; <input type='hidden' value='14:9'>10&nbsp;Now just as he promised, Jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness; I am still here today, 85 years old. <input type='hidden' value='14:10'>11&nbsp;And today I am as strong as on the day Moses sent me out. My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. <input type='hidden' value='14:11'>12&nbsp;Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were An&prime;a&middot;kim there with great fortified cities, surely Jehovah will be with me, and I will drive them out, just as Jehovah promised.&rdquo;

13&nbsp;So Joshua blessed him and gave Heb&prime;ron to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh as an inheritance. <input type='hidden' value='14:13'>14&nbsp;That is why Heb&prime;ron belongs to Ca&prime;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&prime;neh the Ken&prime;iz&middot;zite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. <input type='hidden' value='14:14'>15&nbsp;The name of Heb&prime;ron was previously Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-ar&prime;ba (Ar&prime;ba was the great man among the An&prime;a&middot;kim). And the land had rest from war.

Chapter 15 The land allotted to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of E&prime;dom, the wilderness of Zin, to the Neg&prime;eb at its southern end. <input type='hidden' value='15:1'>2&nbsp;Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. <input type='hidden' value='15:2'>3&nbsp;And it extended south to the ascent of A&middot;krab&prime;bim, passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Ka&prime;desh-bar&prime;ne&middot;a, over to Hez&prime;ron, up to Ad&prime;dar, and went around toward Kar&prime;ka. <input type='hidden' value='15:3'>4&nbsp;Then it passed on to Az&prime;mon and extended to the Wadi of Egypt, and the boundary ended at the Sea. This was their southern boundary.
<input type='hidden' value='15:4'><br><br>

5&nbsp;The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea up to the end of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan. <input type='hidden' value='15:5'>6&nbsp;The boundary went up to Beth-hog&prime;lah and passed over at the north of Beth-ar&prime;a&middot;bah, and the boundary went up to the stone of Bo&prime;han the son of Reu&prime;ben. <input type='hidden' value='15:6'>7&nbsp;The boundary went up to De&prime;bir at the Valley of A&prime;chor and turned northward to Gil&prime;gal, which is in front of the ascent of A&middot;dum&prime;mim that is south of the wadi, and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-she&prime;mesh and ended at En-ro&prime;gel. <input type='hidden' value='15:7'>8&nbsp;The boundary went up to the Valley of the Son of Hin&prime;nom to the slope of the Jeb&prime;u&middot;site at the south, that is, Jerusalem, and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hin&prime;nom to the west, which is at the extremity of the Valley of Reph&prime;a&middot;im to the north. <input type='hidden' value='15:8'>9&nbsp;And the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Neph&middot;to&prime;ah and extended to the cities of Mount E&prime;phron; and the boundary was marked to Ba&prime;al&middot;ah, that is, Kir&prime;i&middot;ath-je&prime;a&middot;rim. <input type='hidden' value='15:9'><br><br>
