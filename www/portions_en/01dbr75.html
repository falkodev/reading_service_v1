<div id='recherchec15v11'><b><a href='#c15v11'>15:11 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 2. A mountain in the NW corner of Judah, between the towns of Shikkeron and Jabneel, forming part of the N boundary of Judah&rsquo;s territory. (Jos 15:11) It may possibly be identified with the hill of Mughar just N of the torrent valley of Sorek and 3&nbsp;km (c.&nbsp;2&nbsp;mi) ESE of Jabneel (modern Yavne).<br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v13'><b><a href='#c15v13'>15:13 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 103</b> : The name applied to a tribe of unusually tall men and perhaps to their progenitor. At Numbers 13:22 and 28 the article is used with the name in Hebrew (ha&middot;&#701;Anaq&prime;). If it is the personal name of the son of &ldquo;Arba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the father of Anak&rdquo; (Jos 15:13), the name thereafter was also applied to his progeny. (Compare Jos 15:14 with 14:15, where Arba is called &ldquo;the great man among the Anakim.&rdquo;)&mdash;See ANAKIM. <br><br><b>1083</b> : However, although the Israelites under Joshua broke the power of the Canaanites, it appears that they did not immediately establish garrisons to hold on to their conquests. Evidently while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Anakim reestablished themselves at Hebron, making it necessary for Caleb (or the sons of Judah under Caleb&rsquo;s leadership) to wrest the city from their control sometime afterward. (Jos 11:21-23;&nbsp;14:12-15;&nbsp;15:13, 14;&nbsp;Jg 1:10) <br></div><br>

<div id='recherchec15v17'><b><a href='#c15v17'>15:17 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 599</b> : Though Joshua&rsquo;s initial campaigns had served to subdue the unified resistance of enemy forces in the land of Canaan, rapidly demolishing all major strongholds, apparently this type of warfare did not allow for the establishing of garrisons to hold the sites of all the destroyed cities. So, a second conquest or &ldquo;mopping up&rdquo; operation was effected at Debir by Othniel, who, because of distinguishing himself in the city&rsquo;s conquest, was given Achsah, the daughter of veteran warrior Caleb, as a wife.&mdash;Jos 15:13-19;&nbsp;Jg 1:11-15. It cannot be ascertained precisely when in Israel&rsquo;s history this second conquest occurred. The book of Judges opens with the phrase &ldquo;after the death of Joshua,&rdquo; and the account of Caleb&rsquo;s taking Debir follows thereafter. (Jg 1:11-15) This, according to some, would make Judah&rsquo;s conquest of Debir subsequent to Joshua&rsquo;s death and would mean that the similar account found at Joshua 15:13-19 was a later addition to the book bearing Joshua&rsquo;s name. However, others view Judges 1:1 as only a formal introduction to connect it with the book of Joshua, arguing that Caleb would hardly wait for years until Joshua died before driving the Anakim from his promised possession. Hence, they consider the Judges account to be a restatement of that in Joshua. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v18'><b><a href='#c15v18'>15:18 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 218</b> : Clapping the hands might be a gesture merely to command attention, as at Joshua 15:18. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec15v22'><b><a href='#c15v22'>15:22 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 178</b> : 3. A town in the southern part of the territory of Judah. After David&rsquo;s victory over the Amalekite raiders he distributed portions of the spoil to the older men of the city. (1Sa 30:26,&nbsp;28) It is identified with Khirbet &#701;Ar&#701;arah (Horvat &#701;Aro&#701;er), about 17&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) SE of Beer-sheba, where the ruins of a fort remain. Some scholars believe that it may be the same place as the &ldquo;Adadah&rdquo; of Joshua 15:22, the Hebrew letter da&prime;leth (&#1491;)&nbsp;being substituted for rehsh (&#1512;)&nbsp;in both instances. <br></div><br><br>
