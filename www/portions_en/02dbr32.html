21&nbsp;And the cities of the tribe of Benjamin by their families were: Jer&prime;i&middot;cho, Beth-hog&prime;lah, E&prime;mek-ke&prime;ziz, <input type='hidden' value='18:21'>22&nbsp;Beth-ar&prime;a&middot;bah, Zem&middot;a&middot;ra&prime;im, Beth&prime;el, <input type='hidden' value='18:22'>23&nbsp;Av&prime;vim, Pa&prime;rah, Oph&prime;rah, <input type='hidden' value='18:23'>24&nbsp;Che&prime;phar-am&prime;mo&middot;ni, Oph&prime;ni, and Ge&prime;ba&mdash;12 cities and their settlements.

Chapter 19 Then the second lot came out for Sim&prime;e&middot;on, for the tribe of Sim&prime;e&middot;on by their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah. <input type='hidden' value='19:1'>2&nbsp;Their inheritance was Be&prime;er-she&prime;ba with She&prime;ba, Mo&middot;la&prime;dah, <input type='hidden' value='19:2'><a id='c19v3' href='#recherchec19v3'>3</a>&nbsp;Ha&prime;zar-shu&prime;al, Ba&prime;lah, E&prime;zem, <input type='hidden' value='19:3'>4&nbsp;El&middot;to&prime;lad, Be&prime;thul, Hor&prime;mah, <input type='hidden' value='19:4'>5&nbsp;Zik&prime;lag, Beth-mar&prime;ca&middot;both, Ha&prime;zar-su&prime;sah, <input type='hidden' value='19:5'>6&nbsp;Beth-le&middot;ba&prime;oth, and Sha&middot;ru&prime;hen&mdash;13 cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:6'><a id='c19v7' href='#recherchec19v7'>7</a>&nbsp;A&prime;in, Rim&prime;mon, E&prime;ther, and A&prime;shan&mdash;four cities and their settlements; <input type='hidden' value='19:7'>8&nbsp;and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Ba&prime;al&middot;ath-be&prime;er, Ra&prime;mah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Sim&prime;e&middot;on by their families. <input type='hidden' value='19:8'>9&nbsp;The inheritance of the descendants of Sim&prime;e&middot;on was taken out of the allotment of Judah, because the share of Judah was too large for them. So the descendants of Sim&prime;e&middot;on received a possession within their inheritance.

<div id='recherchec19v3'><b><a href='#c19v3'>19:3 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 231</b> : 3. A town in the Negeb region of Judah (Jos 15:29), evidently referred to as Balah in Joshua 19:3 and Bilhah in 1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:29. It was subsequently allotted to the tribe of Simeon as an enclave city. Its specific location is unknown, but evidently it lay to the SE of Beer-sheba. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v7'><b><a href='#c19v7'>19:7 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 766</b> : Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#701;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&nbsp;While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult. <br></div><br>
<div id='recherchec19v20'><b><a href='#c19v20'>19:20 </a></b> <br><b>it-1 569</b> : A city mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Jos 19:10,&nbsp;12) but regarded as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture ground to Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom). (Jos 21:27, 28;&nbsp;1Ch 6:71,&nbsp;72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many geographers think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in the text of Vatican Manuscript No.&nbsp;1209.&mdash;See RABBITH. <br></div><br><br>
