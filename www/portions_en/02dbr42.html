Judah will remain in his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their territory to the north. <input type='hidden' value='18:5'>6&nbsp;As for you, map out the land into seven shares, and bring them here to me, and I will cast lots here for you before Jehovah our God. <input type='hidden' value='18:6'>7&nbsp;But the Levites have no share among you, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad, Reu&prime;ben, and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&prime;seh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.&rdquo;
